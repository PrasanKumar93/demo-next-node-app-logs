  "feedback": " -The plan does not explicitly confirm whether `firstName` is required in the current product; it should instruct implementers to verify existing required/optional behavior and apply the rule accordingly (validation rule #1 vs assumption #4).\n -Step 3 is ambiguous about whether non-letter characters should be blocked at input-time or only validated with an error; the requirements only mandate blocking length overflow, but the plan should clearly state the intended UX for non-letters to avoid inconsistent implementations.\n -The plan mentions trimming whitespace but does not clearly define where trimming occurs (onChange vs onBlur vs onSubmit) and how that interacts with the 6-character cap; this can cause edge-case mismatches between FE and BE.\n -Backend enforcement is described in Step 5/6, but the plan does not specify which HTTP status code to use (400 vs 422) and the exact error response shape expected by the frontend; acceptance criteria require a field-level 4xx error and consistency.\n -Step 7 suggests model/schema constraints but also says avoid DB migrations; it should instruct implementers to first check existing DB column length and only change model constraints if it won’t require a migration or if migrations are already standard in the repo, otherwise rely on request validation.\n -The plan references several 'suggested files' but does not include a concrete instruction to locate the actual current files/paths in the repo (since the provided paths are hypothetical); Aider needs an explicit 'search and confirm actual locations' step to be executable.\n -Error copy is proposed, but the plan doesn’t specify whether FE should show one combined message for both regex and length or separate messages; it should align with the existing form error pattern to keep UX consistent.\n -Step 3 mentions `maxLength={6}` plus onChange/onPaste guards, but it doesn’t call out IME/composition events (e.g., `onCompositionEnd`) which can bypass naive onChange slicing in some cases; at least note to verify behavior with the existing input component.\n -Step 6 says 'ensure no DB write occurs' but does not explicitly instruct to verify that validation runs before any side effects (e.g., service calls, events) in the controller/service layer; this is important for AC #3/#4.",
