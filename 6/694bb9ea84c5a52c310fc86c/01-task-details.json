  "llmTaskExplanation": "Update the Student Registration page so the `firstName` field only accepts English alphabet characters (A–Z/a–z) and is limited to a maximum length of 6 characters. Implement this validation consistently in two places: (1) the frontend form validation (prevent/flag invalid input and block submission) and (2) the backend validation layer (schema/model/DTO/request validator) so that API requests with invalid `firstName` are rejected even if the frontend is bypassed. The UI should block additional input beyond 6 characters (not just show an error) and show a clear validation message when the user enters non-English characters. The backend should return an appropriate field-level 4xx validation error response for invalid payloads.",
  "validations": [
    "firstName is required (if the registration form currently requires it); empty/whitespace-only values are invalid",
    "firstName must contain English letters only: A–Z and a–z (no digits, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, accents/diacritics, emojis, or other unicode letters)",
    "firstName length must be <= 6 characters (counting characters as entered; reject length 7+)",
    "Frontend input must prevent entry beyond 6 characters (e.g., via maxLength and/or input handler) including paste; do not allow the field value to exceed 6",
    "Trim leading/trailing whitespace before validating (so ' John ' validates as 'John' if trimming is standard in the app)",
    "Frontend must block form submission when firstName is invalid and display an inline error message using standard best-practice copy",
    "Backend must reject requests with invalid firstName and return a validation error (4xx) with a field-specific message"
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Frontend: allows submission when firstName is valid and length <= 6 (e.g., 'John', 'ABCdef')",
    "Frontend: boundary tests for length: 6 chars passes, 7 chars cannot be entered (value remains 6) and submission is blocked if validation still detects overflow attempts",
    "Frontend: when typing beyond 6 characters, input value does not exceed 6 (e.g., type 'Johnnyy' results in 'Johnny')",
    "Frontend: when pasting a longer value, input value does not exceed 6 (e.g., paste 'Christopher' results in first 6 chars only) and no submission occurs with >6 length",
    "Frontend: shows validation error and blocks submission when firstName contains non-English characters (e.g., 'Jöhn', '张三', 'John1', 'John Doe', 'John-Doe', \"O'Nei\")",
    "Frontend: if trimming is applied, ' John ' is treated as 'John' and passes; if not applied, ensure behavior matches existing app conventions",
    "Backend: accepts payload with valid firstName length <= 6 and English letters only",
    "Backend: rejects payload where firstName length is 7+ with 4xx validation error and includes field name in error details",
    "Backend: rejects payload where firstName contains non-English characters with 4xx validation error",
    "Backend: rejects payload where firstName is missing/empty (only if firstName is required by current business rules)",
    "Integration-style (if present in repo): submitting the registration form with invalid firstName does not call success path / does not create a student record"
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user is on the Student Registration page, when they attempt to enter more than 6 characters in firstName (typing or paste), then the field value is prevented from exceeding 6 characters",
    "Given a user is on the Student Registration page, when they enter a firstName containing any non-English character (non A–Z/a–z), then an inline validation message is shown and the form cannot be submitted",
    "Given a user submits the registration request directly to the backend with firstName longer than 6 characters, then the backend responds with a 4xx validation error and does not create/update the student",
    "Given a user submits the registration request directly to the backend with firstName containing non-English characters, then the backend responds with a 4xx validation error and does not create/update the student",
    "Given a user enters a valid firstName of 1–6 English letters, when they submit, then the submission succeeds (assuming all other required fields are valid)"
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Use existing frontend form validation approach already in the repo (e.g., React Hook Form + resolver, Formik + Yup, Zod, or custom validators) — do not introduce a new validation library unless necessary",
    "Use existing backend validation mechanism already in the repo (e.g., DTO validation, schema validation, model constraints) to enforce max length and character set"
  ],
  "security": [
    "Enforce server-side validation regardless of frontend checks to prevent bypass",
    "Return field-level validation errors without echoing full request payloads (avoid logging PII unnecessarily)",
    "Sanitize/normalize input consistently (e.g., trimming) to reduce ambiguity and prevent unexpected unicode edge cases"
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Validation should be O(n) on input length and run client-side without noticeable UI lag",
    "Avoid adding heavy new validation dependencies that increase bundle size unless already used in the project"
  ],
  "businessContext": "Student registration requires a constrained first name format: English letters only and a maximum of 6 characters. This supports downstream system constraints (e.g., legacy field length limits) and ensures consistent data quality across the application. The product requirement explicitly disallows punctuation/spaces and requires blocking input beyond the limit.",
  "otherNotes": "Error copy should be standard best-practice and consistent between frontend and backend (e.g., 'First name must be up to 6 English letters (A–Z)'). “English characters only” is strictly alphabets (no spaces/punctuation). Frontend behavior should prevent the field from exceeding 6 characters (including paste) rather than allowing overflow and only showing an error. If the backend already has a shared validation schema used by the frontend, prefer reusing it to avoid drift. Update any API docs or form help text if present. Add/adjust tests in the existing test framework used by the repo.",

      "assumption": "Trimming leading/trailing whitespace is acceptable and consistent with existing input handling; if the app currently preserves whitespace, validation should follow existing conventions."
