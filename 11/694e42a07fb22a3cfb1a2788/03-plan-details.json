  "feedback": " -The plan says “Do NOT include unit tests in this plan,” but tests are explicitly in-scope and required by the task (backend + frontend). The plan should include at least high-level implementation steps for the specified test files to satisfy the in-scope items and acceptance criteria verification.\n -Frontend Step 3/4 assumes `TextInput` supports `inputProps` and `onPaste` passthrough, but the plan doesn’t include a concrete fallback step to update `frontend/src/components/ui/TextInput/` if it currently does not forward these props (this is a key feasibility risk).\n -Step 4’s paste-blocking logic references selectionStart/selectionEnd but doesn’t specify how to access them reliably with the chosen component (MUI TextField via wrapper). The plan should clarify whether the handler is attached to the underlying `<input>` and how to read current value/selection from the event target.\n -Step 5 mentions trimming for validation and “ideally for submission payload too,” but acceptance criteria #3 implies trimming is part of validation; the plan should explicitly state that the submitted payload will use the trimmed `firstName` (not just validate against trimmed) to ensure consistent normalization across UI/API.\n -Backend Step 1 assumes `z.string().trim()` is available/used in the repo’s Zod version and that it trims only outer whitespace; the plan should confirm Zod version behavior or note an alternative approach if `.trim()` isn’t used elsewhere in the codebase.\n -The plan references `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` as optional, but doesn’t specify how to ensure the frontend validation message copy is kept consistent with backend if validators are duplicated; it should clarify the single source of truth for the error strings to meet the “keep error copy consistent” note.",
