  "feedback": " -The plan contradicts the task’s testing scope: it explicitly says “Do not add tests in this planning node,” but this task’s in-scope items and acceptance criteria require adding/adjusting backend and frontend tests; the plan should include a concrete test implementation step list (files, test cases) rather than deferring.\n -Frontend schema location is uncertain (“validators.ts or co-located”); the plan should specify the exact schema name/export and where it is used by StudentRegistrationForm so implementation is unambiguous.\n -Step 4 is vague about how maxLength is applied given the TextInput wrapper; it should confirm the exact prop surface (e.g., `inputProps`, `maxLength`, or `slotProps`) used in this repo to ensure the DOM input actually receives `maxLength=6`.\n -Step 5 assumes the submit handler uses parsed Zod output; the plan should explicitly call out where parsing happens (e.g., react-hook-form resolver vs manual parse) and ensure the API payload uses the trimmed value, otherwise trimming may not affect what is sent.\n -Backend integration is assumed (“create-student request validation uses this schema”); the plan should include a verification step to confirm the create-student route/controller actually validates with `StudentSchema` (or update it if it doesn’t) to satisfy acceptance criteria #2.\n -Error messaging requirements are loosely handled; the plan should ensure both FE and BE return/emit a clear max-length error for `firstName` (and that FE displays it), not just that validation exists.\n -The plan doesn’t explicitly address the ‘should not accept more than 6 letters’ wording vs ‘characters’; it notes the discrepancy but should confirm the chosen interpretation (characters) is applied consistently in UI copy and validation messages.\n -Step 6 suggests modifying the TextInput wrapper if needed but doesn’t include a decision/verification criterion (how to tell if it’s needed) or the specific file name within `frontend/src/components/ui/TextInput/` to change, which may slow implementation.",
