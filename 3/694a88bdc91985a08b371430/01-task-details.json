  "llmTaskExplanation": "This is a legitimate software development task: update the user registration page so the Street Address field is optional (non-mandatory). Implement the change end-to-end so users can submit the registration form without providing a street address, and the backend (if it currently requires the field) accepts missing/empty street address without validation errors. Update any shared validation schemas, form UI indicators (required asterisk), error messages, and API payload construction so that omitting street address does not block registration. Ensure existing behavior remains unchanged for other required fields and that address is still saved when provided.",
  "validations": [
    "Registration form can be submitted when Street Address is empty/null/undefined (no client-side required validation triggered).",
    "If Street Address is provided, it must still pass existing format constraints (e.g., max length, allowed characters) as currently implemented.",
    "Street Address required indicator (e.g., asterisk) is removed and helper/error text does not imply it is required.",
    "Backend validation (request DTO/schema) does not reject missing Street Address; it should accept absent field or empty string per existing conventions.",
    "If Street Address is omitted, the stored user profile/address record should either store null/empty or omit the field without causing errors downstream.",
    "No regression: other required registration fields remain required and still show validation errors when missing.",
    "Edge case: Street Address containing only whitespace is treated as empty (either trimmed to empty and accepted, or validated consistently with existing trimming rules)."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Frontend: submitting registration with all required fields filled except Street Address succeeds (no validation error shown for Street Address).",
    "Frontend: Street Address field does not render a required marker and does not show 'required' error on blur when empty.",
    "Frontend: if Street Address is provided, existing validation rules still apply (e.g., too long triggers error).",
    "Backend: registration endpoint accepts payload without Street Address field and returns success response.",
    "Backend: registration endpoint accepts payload with Street Address as empty string (if client sends it) and returns success (or normalizes to null) according to existing conventions.",
    "Backend: other required fields missing still return validation errors (regression test).",
    "Integration (if present): end-to-end registration flow works with Street Address omitted and user record is created."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given I am on the registration page, when I leave Street Address blank and fill all other required fields, then I can successfully submit the form and create an account.",
    "Given I am on the registration page, when Street Address is blank, then no 'Street Address is required' validation message is shown and the field is not marked as required.",
    "Given I enter a Street Address, when it violates existing constraints (e.g., exceeds max length), then I see the appropriate validation error and cannot submit until corrected.",
    "Given the registration API receives a request without Street Address, when it validates the request, then it does not reject the request due to missing Street Address.",
    "Given I register without Street Address, when I later view the created user/profile data (where applicable), then the system does not error and the address field is simply empty/absent."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Use existing form library and validation approach already in the repo (e.g., React Hook Form/Formik + Yup/Zod) rather than introducing a new one.",
    "Use existing backend validation framework already in the repo (e.g., class-validator, Joi, Zod, Rails validations, etc.)."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Continue to treat address as PII: avoid logging full street address in plaintext application logs.",
    "Maintain existing server-side validation/sanitization to prevent injection (e.g., trim input, reject unexpected types).",
    "Ensure no authorization changes are introduced; registration remains publicly accessible only as currently designed."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "No meaningful performance impact expected; avoid adding heavy new dependencies.",
    "Keep client bundle size unchanged by reusing existing validation utilities."
  ],
  "businessContext": "Making Street Address optional reduces friction during sign-up and can improve conversion. Address can be collected later (e.g., during checkout/profile completion) while still allowing account creation. UX should clearly indicate which fields are required and which are optional.",
  "otherNotes": "Update any copy/i18n strings that mention Street Address as required. If analytics events track validation errors or form completion, ensure the change does not break event payloads. If there are downstream flows that assume address exists (shipping, billing), they should already handle missing address or be addressed separately (out of scope unless registration currently breaks).",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "There is a registration page with a Street Address input currently marked required and enforced by client-side validation."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "There is a backend registration endpoint that may validate required fields and may currently require street address."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The project already has an established form validation approach (schema-based or imperative) that should be modified rather than replaced."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "If the client sends an empty string for Street Address, the backend can accept it or normalize it to null without breaking persistence."

    },
    {
      "question": "When Street Address is omitted, should the system store it as null, empty string, or omit the field entirely (preference for reporting/exports)?",
