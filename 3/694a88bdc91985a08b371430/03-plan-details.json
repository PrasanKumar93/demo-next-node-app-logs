  "feedback": " -The plan conflicts with the node constraint \"Focus ONLY on core feature implementation (no tests in this node)\" by including Step 10 about updating tests and a detailed \"Tests to add/update\" section; it should explicitly exclude test work from the implementation steps for this node.\n -Step 9 mentions DB NOT NULL constraints but does not specify how to verify whether such a constraint exists or where (migration/schema/model) to check; without that, feasibility of storing null/empty per conventions is unclear and could block acceptance criteria #6.\n -The plan does not explicitly call out ensuring the UI does not set accessibility required attributes (e.g., aria-required) for Street Address beyond a brief mention; it should be clearer that both visual required markers and programmatic required flags must be removed to satisfy the UI requirement.\n -Step 3/4 describe trimming/normalization options but do not commit to a single approach aligned with existing repo patterns; the plan should instruct to first identify the current normalization mechanism (schema transform vs form setValueAs vs global trim) and then apply the same mechanism to Street Address to meet the whitespace-only requirement consistently.\n -Step 5 is ambiguous about whether the frontend should omit the field or send an empty string; since backend must accept both, the plan should still require choosing one consistent payload convention used elsewhere in the codebase to avoid inconsistent API behavior.\n -Step 7 notes allowing empty string in backend validation but does not highlight a common pitfall: many validator frameworks treat \"optional\" as \"undefined only\" and still validate \"\"; the plan should explicitly require handling empty string (\"\" and whitespace-only) so it doesn't trigger length/pattern validators when considered empty.\n -Step 10 suggests changing shared address schemas but does not clearly guard against weakening requirements in other flows (checkout/shipping) beyond a general note; it should explicitly require a registration-specific schema/variant if the address schema is shared, to stay within scope and avoid regressions.\n -The plan references i18n updates (Step 6) but does not specify how to ensure no stale 'required' error message can still surface (e.g., via generic required message mapping); it should include checking any centralized error-message mapping for Street Address requiredness.\n -The plan does not explicitly mention verifying analytics/telemetry payloads that may include a 'streetAddressRequired' flag or validation error codes, despite the additional notes; it should include a quick check to ensure the change doesn't break event schemas (without adding PII logging).",
