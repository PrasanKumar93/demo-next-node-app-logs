  "feedback": " -The plan says “do not include unit tests in this plan,” but the task requirements explicitly include updating/adding frontend and backend tests; the plan should at least include a step to update the listed test files to meet acceptance criteria #1–#4 and the persistence test requirement.\n -Step 4 (client validation) is ambiguous about how to handle empty string vs undefined vs null; it should explicitly ensure the chosen schema accepts both omitted and empty-string values without triggering other validators (e.g., regex/min) while still enforcing constraints when a non-empty value is provided.\n -Step 6 (backend validation) similarly needs explicit handling for empty string vs undefined; many validators treat empty string as “present” and will run regex/length checks—plan should call out ensuring empty string is accepted (or define that the client will omit the field) to satisfy acceptance criteria #1 and #3.\n -Whitespace-only preservation (acceptance criteria #4) is addressed conceptually, but the plan doesn’t identify where trimming might already occur (e.g., shared sanitization middleware, request body normalization, ORM hooks). Add an explicit step to audit and confirm no existing trim/normalize is applied to Street Address on either client or server, and to scope any necessary exclusion to Street Address only.\n -Step 10 (graceful rendering) is too vague: it doesn’t name likely components/pages or a concrete approach to find usages (e.g., search for `streetAddress`/`address1` concatenations). Add a clear instruction to locate and update all render/format helpers to avoid literal 'undefined' and awkward punctuation, per acceptance criteria #5.\n -Persistence step (Step 9) doesn’t specify how to determine whether the DB column is currently NOT NULL (e.g., inspect ORM schema/migrations) and what the column name actually is (`street_address` vs `streetAddress`); add a concrete check to avoid creating an unnecessary or incorrect migration.\n -Backend route step (Step 7) should explicitly mention updating any DTO/type definitions used by the route (or shared types) to avoid TypeScript compile errors and to ensure the field is optional end-to-end; Step 11 mentions shared types but is conditional—make it a required check if the repo uses shared request types.\n -The plan doesn’t explicitly confirm that optionality applies to all regions/users beyond stating it; if there is existing conditional validation (e.g., based on country), add a step to search for conditional rules and remove/override them to satisfy acceptance criteria #6.",
