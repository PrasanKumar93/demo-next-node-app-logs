  "feedback": " -The plan says “DO NOT add unit tests in this node,” but the task requirements explicitly include adding/updating tests (frontend + backend) and the checklist mentions task documentation/deployment; the plan should include concrete test update steps (even if not implemented here) to satisfy in-scope items #7 and the “Tests to add/update” section.\n -Step 11 says to add a migration only if needed, but the plan does not specify how to determine whether the DB column is NOT NULL (e.g., which schema file/migration history to inspect) or how to verify the column name/table name; add explicit discovery/verification actions to avoid missing a required migration (validation rule #8).\n -The plan mentions allowing null on backend “if applicable,” but acceptance criteria/validation rules require create/update succeed when streetAddress is missing, null, or empty string; the plan should explicitly require backend schemas to accept both null and empty string (rules #5–#7) rather than leaving null optional.\n -Update semantics are noted, but Step 9/Step 8 do not explicitly require fixing common “falsy filtering” patterns in update payload construction on BOTH frontend and backend (e.g., dropping \"\"), which is critical to AC2/AC4; call out where payload builders/patch mappers live and ensure they use undefined checks rather than truthy checks.\n -Step 2/4 mention removing required indicator/aria-required, but the plan does not mention updating any shared form field component that may automatically render required markers based on schema/props; add a check for reusable Input/Field components to ensure Street Address is not implicitly marked required.\n -The plan does not explicitly address API documentation or contract types (e.g., OpenAPI/TypeScript types) that may still mark streetAddress as required; acceptance criteria don’t demand it, but the task notes say to update docs/comments if they state it’s required—add a step to search/update API types/docs to prevent mismatches.\n -Step 12 focuses on not introducing trimming, but the plan does not include a verification step to ensure existing sanitization middleware (frontend or backend) isn’t already trimming streetAddress and thereby violating the whitespace-preservation requirement; add an explicit audit/check to confirm round-trip behavior for whitespace-only values.\n -The plan lists many suggested file paths as “likely,” but does not include a concrete repo-search command/process (beyond a general search) to ensure all occurrences are found (e.g., street_address vs streetAddress, AddressLine1 naming); add explicit search terms/locations to reduce risk of missing coupled validations (especially if city/state/zip validation is tied to streetAddress).\n -Step 10 conflates model-level validation and ORM nullability; it should explicitly require aligning ORM schema (allowNull/nullable) with DB nullability and ensuring serialization/deserialization layers don’t coerce null/undefined/\"\"—otherwise persistence may still reject or mutate values (rules #7–#9).\n -The checklist includes task documentation and deployment, but the plan does not mention updating any release notes/changelog or deployment steps/migration execution; add explicit steps to satisfy the checklist items.",
