  "feedback": " -The plan says “Add/adjust tests” but also states “Focus only on implementing the feature (no tests in this planning node)”; this conflicts with the task requirements that explicitly include backend + frontend tests—clarify whether tests are in scope for this plan and, if so, add concrete test steps per the provided test file paths.\n -Step 2 is too vague about which specific backend API route files will be updated (e.g., exact paths under `backend/src/api/**`); identify the actual create/update student handlers so Aider can reliably implement and reviewers can verify acceptance criteria #5 (reject before DB write).\n -Backend error handling is not specified enough: the plan should state the expected status code (400 vs 422) and the error response shape (e.g., Zod issues array, field->message map) so the frontend can consistently surface backend validation errors as required.\n -Frontend validation integration is underspecified: the plan doesn’t confirm whether the form uses Zod, React Hook Form, custom state, or shared validators; it should explicitly state where the trimmed-length check will live (e.g., in `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` and invoked by the form) to ensure it’s actually enforced on submit and on paste.\n -Acceptance criteria #1 requires the input “does not allow more than 6 characters to be entered”; the plan mentions `maxLength={6}` but doesn’t address cases where the input is controlled and state updates might still allow >6 characters—clarify that the onChange handler will also guard/truncate or validate to ensure the UI behavior matches the criterion.\n -Step 4 notes not silently truncating pasted values, but the acceptance criteria emphasize blocking submit + showing an error; the plan should explicitly state the intended UX for paste >6 (keep value and show error vs truncate and show error) to avoid ambiguous implementation.\n -The plan mentions update endpoints may use `StudentSchema.partial()` but doesn’t specify how trimming/max validation behaves when `firstName` is omitted vs provided; add a clear note that the constraint applies only when `firstName` is present on updates to avoid unintended validation failures.\n -The plan references possible files like `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` and `backend/src/schemas/index.ts` without confirming they exist; it should instruct to first locate the actual API client/error normalization layer and schema export pattern used in the repo to keep changes minimal and accurate.",
