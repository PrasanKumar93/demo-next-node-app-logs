  "feedback": " -The plan doesn’t explicitly confirm coverage of all required primary-related tokens listed in the task overview (primary/accent, link color, primary button background, focus/active states); it mentions them generally but should call out ensuring each of these specific tokens exists and is updated in the core token source.\n -Step 2/3 provide example hex values but do not specify a concrete approach to ensure WCAG AA contrast (validation rule #3) beyond “typically OK”; the plan should include an explicit check method (e.g., contrast check on primary button text and link text on background) as part of validation.\n -The plan assumes a single centralized token source but doesn’t include a decisive branching procedure if both CSS variables and a TS theme object exist (e.g., MUI theme + CSS vars); it should clarify which is authoritative and how to avoid mismatched tokens across systems.\n -Step 5 (Tailwind) is vague about how to handle Tailwind color scales (e.g., primary-50..900) if the codebase relies on them; it should note verifying any scale-based utilities still work or are mapped appropriately to tokens.\n -Step 4 mentions global focus styles but doesn’t explicitly address focus visibility on red surfaces (acceptance criterion #3) with a concrete token strategy (e.g., dual-ring/offset) to prevent the ring blending into the red button background; it’s only listed as an edge case.\n -Step 7 says to remove hardcoded colors “only if found” but doesn’t include a concrete repo-wide search step for the previous brand color(s) to ensure no lingering hardcoded values remain (validation rule #1 and global propagation).\n -The plan doesn’t explicitly mention verifying key UI surfaces called out in the task overview (nav, headers) beyond a general manual sweep; it should ensure those specific areas are checked and that their styling is token-driven.\n -Dark mode handling (Step 3) is described conceptually but lacks specificity on how dark mode is detected/implemented in the repo (class, data attribute, media query) and how to ensure both palettes are updated without missing one selector/theme object.\n -Step 8 notes preserving semantic colors but doesn’t include a concrete check for components that might incorrectly use `primary` for status UI (e.g., alert variants mapped to primary); it should include verifying semantic token mappings in the component library/theme config if present.\n -The plan’s validation section mentions checking computed styles, but it doesn’t specify verifying hover/active/disabled states are distinct for both buttons and links (acceptance criteria #2) in a repeatable way (e.g., which CSS variables/tokens should differ and be inspected).",
