+
+## TASK OVERVIEW
+
+**Description**: 
+
+**Detailed Explanation**: 
+Update the application’s UI color theme so the primary brand color is red by changing the centralized/core color tokens (the core colors file) so the change propagates consistently across the entire app. Any reasonable red shade is acceptable. Avoid hardcoding red in individual components; instead, update the global theme tokens (primary/accent, link color, primary button background, focus/active states) and ensure the change is reflected consistently. Ensure adequate contrast and that interactive states (hover/active/disabled) remain visually distinct. If the app supports light/dark modes, update both palettes accordingly. Verify key UI surfaces (buttons, links, nav, headers, form focus rings, alerts) reflect the new red theme without regressions.
+
+**Business Context**:
+This is a branding/UX update: the product’s primary brand color is changing to red. The goal is consistent visual identity across the entire application by updating the centralized/core color tokens while maintaining accessibility and usability (readable text, visible focus states, clear interaction states).
+
+**Aider instructions**:
+## Task: Change color theme to red (global)
+
+Update the app’s **primary/brand theme color** to **red** by editing the **centralized/core colors/tokens source** (any red shade is acceptable). The change must apply **globally across the entire app**.
+
+### Implementation requirements
+- Update the global theme token(s) for primary/brand color to a red value.
+- Ensure primary UI elements reflect the change: primary buttons, links, active nav states, and form focus rings.
+- Ensure interaction states remain distinct: hover/active/disabled.
+- Preserve semantic colors (success/warning/error) unless they are explicitly tied to the primary token.
+- If light/dark mode exists, update both palettes with appropriate red shades for contrast.
+- Maintain accessibility: readable text on red backgrounds and visible focus indicators.
+
+### Likely files to touch (depending on what the repo uses)
+- `src/theme.ts` / `src/theme/index.ts` (theme object / token assembly)
+- `src/styles/theme.css` and/or `src/styles/globals.css` (CSS variables / core colors)
+- `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.ts` (Tailwind color tokens)
+- Verify provider wiring in `src/App.tsx` / `src/main.tsx`
+
+### Validations / checks
+- Primary token resolves to red and is consumed by components (no per-component hardcoding).
+- Hover/active/disabled states are visually distinct.
+- Focus ring/outline remains visible.
+- No unintended changes to semantic status colors.
+- Dark mode (if present) still uses red primary with readable text.
+
+### Tests to add/update
+- Theme config test: primary token resolves to a red value from the core colors source.
+- Component tests: primary Button and Link use theme primary color (and hover state uses the correct token).
+- Focus state test: focus indicator present on keyboard navigation.
+- Dark mode test (if supported): primary remains red and readable.
+- Regression: success/warning/error alerts keep semantic colors.
+
+### Constraints
+- Prefer token changes over duplicative CSS rules.
+- Do not add new theming frameworks or heavy dependencies.
+- No new external calls or logging.
+
+
+---
+
+## SCOPE DEFINITION
+
+### IN SCOPE
+
+1. Update the primary theme color to red via the app’s centralized theming/tokens (core colors file).
+2. Apply the change globally across the entire app (all pages) by updating centralized tokens rather than per-component overrides.
+3. Update related interaction state colors (hover/active/focus) to match the red theme while preserving usability.
+4. Ensure consistent application across common components (buttons, links, nav active states, form focus rings).
+5. Add/update unit tests that verify theme token wiring and key component styling behavior.
+
+### OUT OF SCOPE
+
+1. Redesigning layouts, typography, spacing, or component structure.
+2. Changing semantic status colors (success/warning/error) unless explicitly requested.
+3. Introducing a new UI framework or major dependency solely to implement theming.
+4. Building a new theming system if one already exists (only adjust existing system).
+
+---
+
+## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
+
+1. Given a user views any page in the app, when the page loads, then primary buttons and links use the new red theme color sourced from the centralized/core colors file.
+2. Given a user hovers or presses a primary button/link, when the state changes, then the hover/active styling is visibly distinct and still within the red theme.
+3. Given a keyboard user tabs through interactive elements, when focus lands on primary themed controls, then a visible focus indicator is present.
+4. Given the app supports dark mode, when dark mode is enabled, then the primary theme remains red and text remains readable on primary surfaces.
+5. Given the app shows success/warning/error UI, when those components render, then their colors remain semantically correct and are not unintentionally changed to red.
+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
+
+### Dependencies & Technologies
+
+1. Use the existing theming mechanism already present in the repo (e.g., CSS variables, Tailwind theme config, or a UI library theme provider).
+2. Prefer updating the centralized/core colors file (design tokens) so the change applies globally.
+3. If Tailwind is used: update tailwind.config.* theme.extend.colors (or CSS variables feeding Tailwind).
+4. If a component library is used (e.g., MUI/Chakra): update the central theme configuration rather than per-component overrides.
+
+### Validation Rules
+
+1. Primary theme color token in the centralized/core colors file is set to a red hue and is used by primary UI elements (primary buttons, links, active nav states) without per-component hardcoding.
+2. Hover/active/disabled states for primary actions remain visually distinct from the default state (no identical colors across states).
+3. Text/icon contrast on red backgrounds meets WCAG AA where applicable (at minimum, primary button label remains readable).
+4. Focus indicators remain visible on red-themed components (focus ring/outline not removed and not blending into background).
+5. If light/dark themes exist, both modes use the red primary color with appropriate shades for readability.
+6. No unintended changes to semantic colors (success/warning/error) unless they are explicitly tied to the primary theme token.
+7. Theme change does not break layout or cause visual regressions due to token name mismatches or missing variables.

+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS
+
+1. The project has a centralized theming system (theme file, CSS variables, Tailwind config, or UI library theme provider) that can be updated to propagate the new primary color.
+2. “Change color theme to red” refers to the primary/accent brand color, not changing all semantic colors (success/warning/error) to red.
+3. The app may support light/dark mode; if it does, both palettes should be updated.
+4. There is a centralized/core colors file used as the source of truth for theme tokens, and updating it will apply the red theme globally.
+5. Any reasonable red shade is acceptable as the primary brand color.
+
+---
+
+## SUGGESTED FILE CHANGES
+
+
+1. **File**: `src/theme.ts`
+   **Rationale**: If a JS/TS theme object is used (MUI/Chakra/styled-components), update palette primary to a red shade and adjust shades for hover/active/focus/disabled.
+
+2. **File**: `src/theme/index.ts`
+   **Rationale**: If theme tokens are re-exported/assembled here, ensure the primary/brand token points to the updated red value from the core colors source.
+
+3. **File**: `src/styles/theme.css`
+   **Rationale**: If CSS variables are used as the core colors file, update --color-primary/--brand and related variables; ensure focus ring variables remain visible.
+
+4. **File**: `src/styles/globals.css`
+   **Rationale**: If global CSS defines or overrides core color variables, update them to red and ensure global link/focus styles still reference tokens.
+
+5. **File**: `tailwind.config.js`
+   **Rationale**: If Tailwind is used, update the primary/brand color tokens to red and ensure variants exist for hover/active (prefer CSS-variable driven tokens if present).
+
+6. **File**: `tailwind.config.ts`
+   **Rationale**: If Tailwind config is TS, update the primary/brand color tokens to red and ensure variants exist for hover/active.
+
+7. **File**: `src/App.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: Verify theme provider wiring and ensure the updated theme is applied globally.
+
+8. **File**: `src/components/Button.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: If buttons have local overrides, ensure they reference theme tokens rather than hardcoded colors; update tests accordingly.
+
+9. **File**: `src/components/Link.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: Ensure link styling uses the primary token and hover state is correct; update tests accordingly.
+
+10. **File**: `src/__tests__/theme.test.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Add/adjust tests to assert primary token is red and components consume it.
+
+---
+
+## ADDITIONAL NOTES
+
+Any red shade is acceptable. Implement by changing the centralized/core colors file (design tokens) so all pages inherit the update. If the app has design tokens documented (e.g., in a theme file), update those tokens and any related documentation/storybook examples. Consider adding/adjusting snapshots if the repo uses visual regression testing. Ensure any marketing/brand pages and auth pages also inherit the updated theme.

+
+## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM PLANNING NODE
+
+The following comprehensive plan was created by the planning node. Follow this plan to implement the feature:
+
+### 1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS
+
+The feedback is: **“just focus on core theme file.”**  
+So the plan is revised to **minimize branching and touching multiple layers**. The implementation will:
+
+- Identify the **single centralized/core colors file** (the “source of truth” tokens file).
+- Change **only that file** (and only the tokens that represent the brand/primary theme and its interaction states).
+- Rely on existing wiring so the change **propagates globally** without editing components, Tailwind config, or provider code—unless the “core theme file” itself contains both palettes/modes.
+
+**What to determine (read-only) before editing:**
+1. **Which file is the core token source?** One of:
+   - `src/styles/theme.css` (CSS variables / design tokens)
+   - `src/theme.ts` or `src/theme/index.ts` (TS theme object tokens)
+2. **Does that same file include dark mode tokens?**
+   - CSS variables: `.dark { ... }` / `[data-theme="dark"] { ... }` / `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
+   - TS theme: `lightTheme`/`darkTheme` or `createTheme({ palette: { mode } })`
+
+**Tokens that must exist in the core file (or be added there if missing):**
+- `primary` / `brand` / `accent` (base)
+- `primaryHover`, `primaryActive`, `primaryDisabled` (or equivalent)
+- `onPrimary` (text/icon on primary)
+- `link`, `linkHover`
+- `focusRing` (or ring/outline token used by focus styles)
+
+This keeps the change **centralized** and avoids per-component hardcoding.
+
+---
+
+### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+
+1. **Edit only the core theme/tokens file** (the centralized source of truth).
+2. Update the **primary/brand** token(s) to a **red** shade and update **related interaction tokens** (hover/active/disabled/focus/link) in the same file.
+3. If the core file contains **both light and dark palettes**, update both there.
+4. Do **not** modify:
+   - individual components
+   - Tailwind config
+   - global CSS focus rules
+   - ThemeProvider wiring  
+   …unless those are actually part of the same “core theme file” in this repo.
+
+This directly addresses the feedback by constraining scope to the core theme file while still meeting the acceptance criteria via token propagation.
+
+---
+
+### 3. COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
+
+**Step 1: Locate the core theme/tokens file (no code changes yet)**
+- **File(s)**:  
+  `src/styles/theme.css`, `src/styles/globals.css`, `src/theme.ts`, `src/theme/index.ts`
+- **Action**: Determine which file is the **centralized/core color tokens** source.
+- **Details**:
+  - Look for definitions of primary/link/ring tokens (CSS vars or TS theme palette).
+  - Confirm this file is imported/used globally (directly or via theme assembly).
+- **Rationale**: Ensures we change the correct single file and avoid touching other layers.
+- **Addresses**: Global propagation requirement; validation rule #1.
+
+---
+
+**Step 2: Update light-mode primary/brand tokens to red (in the core theme file only)**
+- **File**: the identified core theme file (e.g., `src/styles/theme.css` OR `src/theme.ts`)
+- **Action**: Change the primary/brand/accent token(s) to a red hue and ensure dependent tokens are consistent.
+- **Details** (adapt to actual token names in the file):
+  - Set `primary/brand` to a reasonable accessible red (example target: a “600–700” red range).
+  - Ensure these are updated (or added) in the same file:
+    - `primaryHover`: darker than primary
+    - `primaryActive`: darker than hover
+    - `primaryDisabled`: lighter/desaturated or intended disabled treatment
+    - `onPrimary`: ensure readable (commonly `#fff`)
+    - `link`: red aligned with primary (often slightly darker than button red for readability on white)
+    - `linkHover`: darker than link
+    - `focusRing`: visible on neutral backgrounds (often a lighter red/pink or alpha-based ring)
+- **Rationale**: This is the minimum set of tokens needed to make buttons/links/focus states reflect the new brand color globally.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria 1–3; validation rules #1–4.
+
+---
+
+**Step 3: Update dark-mode primary tokens to red (only if dark mode tokens live in the same core file)**
+- **File**: same core theme file as Step 2
+- **Action**: Update the dark palette’s primary/link/focus tokens to red shades appropriate for dark UI.
+- **Details**:
+  - If the file contains a dark block/object, update the same token set:
+    - `primary`, `primaryHover`, `primaryActive`, `primaryDisabled`
+    - `onPrimary`
+    - `link`, `linkHover`
+    - `focusRing`
+  - Choose a red that remains legible on dark surfaces (often slightly brighter than light-mode primary).
+- **Rationale**: Keeps branding consistent across modes while maintaining contrast.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion 4; validation rules #3–5.
+
+---
+
+**Step 4: Ensure semantic status colors remain unchanged (within the core theme file)**
+- **File**: core theme file
+- **Action**: Verify success/warning/error tokens are not modified and are not accidentally derived from `primary`.
+- **Details**:
+  - If the core file defines semantic tokens, leave them as-is.
+  - If semantic tokens reference `primary` (rare but possible), decouple them in the core file only.
+- **Rationale**: Prevents regressions where alerts/badges unintentionally become red.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion 5; validation rule #6.
+
+---
+
+**Step 5: Confirm interaction-state distinctness via token values (core file only)**
+- **File**: core theme file
+- **Action**: Ensure hover/active/disabled/focus tokens are visually distinct from base primary.
+- **Details**:
+  - `primaryHover` ≠ `primary`
+  - `primaryActive` ≠ `primaryHover`
+  - `primaryDisabled` clearly distinct (lighter/desaturated/opacity-based depending on system)
+  - `linkHover` ≠ `link`
+  - `focusRing` not identical to primary background (so it doesn’t disappear on red buttons)
+- **Rationale**: Makes hover/active/disabled/focus states clearly perceivable without touching component code.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion 2–3; validation rules #2–4.
+
+---
+
+### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY
+
+Validation is intentionally focused on confirming the **core theme file change propagates** (since we are not editing other files).
+
+1. **Token-level validation (core file)**
+   - Confirm primary/brand token is now red.
+   - Confirm hover/active/disabled/link/focus tokens exist and are updated accordingly.
+   - If dark mode exists in the same file, confirm dark tokens are updated too.
+
+2. **Propagation validation (runtime/manual)**
+   - Inspect in browser devtools computed styles:
+     - Primary button background uses the primary token and is red
+     - Links are red and hover is distinct
+     - Focus ring is visible on keyboard focus
+     - Nav active states (if tied to primary) reflect red
+
+3. **Regression validation**
+   - Check success/warning/error alerts/badges remain their semantic colors.
+
+4. **Contrast sanity checks**
+   - Primary button text vs red background is readable (AA target).
+   - Link red vs page background is readable in light and dark modes.
+
+---
+
+### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS
+
+Even though we won’t edit them, these are the places that must already be wired correctly for the core token change to propagate:
+
+- Global style/theme import: `src/main.tsx` and/or `src/App.tsx`
+- Core tokens file import: `src/styles/theme.css` (if CSS vars) or `src/theme.ts` (if ThemeProvider)
+- Dark mode toggle mechanism (only to verify): `.dark` / `[data-theme]` / theme mode switch
+
+---
+
+### 6. EDGE CASES & CONSIDERATIONS
+
+- **Focus ring on red buttons**: ensure the ring token is not the same red as the button background; use a lighter/alpha ring token in the core file.
+- **Link visited state**: if the core file defines `visited` token, ensure it remains readable and not confusingly close to default link red.
+- **Disabled state**: ensure disabled doesn’t look like hover/active; keep it clearly muted.
+- **Error vs brand red**: error semantic red may be close to brand red; keep error tokens unchanged to avoid semantic confusion.
+
+---
+
+### 7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
+
+- Edit **only the centralized/core theme tokens file** (the source of truth).
+- DO NOT include unit tests (handled separately).
+- Do not hardcode red in individual components.
+- Preserve semantic status colors (success/warning/error).
+- Maintain existing conventions and backward compatibility.

+   **Rationale**: If Tailwind is used, update the primary/brand color tokens to red and ensure variants exist for hover/active (prefer CSS-variable driven tokens if present).
+
+6. **File**: `tailwind.config.ts`
+   **Rationale**: If Tailwind config is TS, update the primary/brand color tokens to red and ensure variants exist for hover/active.
+
+7. **File**: `src/App.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: Verify theme provider wiring and ensure the updated theme is applied globally.
+
+8. **File**: `src/components/Button.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: If buttons have local overrides, ensure they reference theme tokens rather than hardcoded colors; update tests accordingly.
+
+9. **File**: `src/components/Link.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: Ensure link styling uses the primary token and hover state is correct; update tests accordingly.
+
+10. **File**: `src/__tests__/theme.test.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Add/adjust tests to assert primary token is red and components consume it.
+
+---
+
+## ADDITIONAL NOTES
+
+Any red shade is acceptable. Implement by changing the centralized/core colors file (design tokens) so all pages inherit the update. If the app has design tokens documented (e.g., in a theme file), update those tokens and any related documentation/storybook examples. Consider adding/adjusting snapshots if the repo uses visual regression testing. Ensure any marketing/brand pages and auth pages also inherit the updated theme.

+
+## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM PLANNING NODE
+
+The following comprehensive plan was created by the planning node. Follow this plan to implement the feature:
+
+### 1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS
+
+The feedback is: **“just focus on core theme file.”**  
+So the plan is revised to **minimize branching and touching multiple layers**. The implementation will:
+
+- Identify the **single centralized/core colors file** (the “source of truth” tokens file).
+- Change **only that file** (and only the tokens that represent the brand/primary theme and its interaction states).
+- Rely on existing wiring so the change **propagates globally** without editing components, Tailwind config, or provider code—unless the “core theme file” itself contains both palettes/modes.
+
+**What to determine (read-only) before editing:**
+1. **Which file is the core token source?** One of:
+   - `src/styles/theme.css` (CSS variables / design tokens)
+   - `src/theme.ts` or `src/theme/index.ts` (TS theme object tokens)
+2. **Does that same file include dark mode tokens?**
+   - CSS variables: `.dark { ... }` / `[data-theme="dark"] { ... }` / `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
+   - TS theme: `lightTheme`/`darkTheme` or `createTheme({ palette: { mode } })`
+
+**Tokens that must exist in the core file (or be added there if missing):**
+- `primary` / `brand` / `accent` (base)
+- `primaryHover`, `primaryActive`, `primaryDisabled` (or equivalent)
+- `onPrimary` (text/icon on primary)
+- `link`, `linkHover`
+- `focusRing` (or ring/outline token used by focus styles)
+
+This keeps the change **centralized** and avoids per-component hardcoding.
+
+---
+
+### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+
+1. **Edit only the core theme/tokens file** (the centralized source of truth).
+2. Update the **primary/brand** token(s) to a **red** shade and update **related interaction tokens** (hover/active/disabled/focus/link) in the same file.
+3. If the core file contains **both light and dark palettes**, update both there.
+4. Do **not** modify:
+   - individual components
+   - Tailwind config
+   - global CSS focus rules
+   - ThemeProvider wiring  
+   …unless those are actually part of the same “core theme file” in this repo.
+
+This directly addresses the feedback by constraining scope to the core theme file while still meeting the acceptance criteria via token propagation.
+
+---
+
+### 3. COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
+
+**Step 1: Locate the core theme/tokens file (no code changes yet)**
+- **File(s)**:  
+  `src/styles/theme.css`, `src/styles/globals.css`, `src/theme.ts`, `src/theme/index.ts`
+- **Action**: Determine which file is the **centralized/core color tokens** source.
+- **Details**:
+  - Look for definitions of primary/link/ring tokens (CSS vars or TS theme palette).
+  - Confirm this file is imported/used globally (directly or via theme assembly).
+- **Rationale**: Ensures we change the correct single file and avoid touching other layers.
+- **Addresses**: Global propagation requirement; validation rule #1.
+
+---
+
+**Step 2: Update light-mode primary/brand tokens to red (in the core theme file only)**
+- **File**: the identified core theme file (e.g., `src/styles/theme.css` OR `src/theme.ts`)
+- **Action**: Change the primary/brand/accent token(s) to a red hue and ensure dependent tokens are consistent.
+- **Details** (adapt to actual token names in the file):
+  - Set `primary/brand` to a reasonable accessible red (example target: a “600–700” red range).
+  - Ensure these are updated (or added) in the same file:
+    - `primaryHover`: darker than primary
+    - `primaryActive`: darker than hover
+    - `primaryDisabled`: lighter/desaturated or intended disabled treatment
+    - `onPrimary`: ensure readable (commonly `#fff`)
+    - `link`: red aligned with primary (often slightly darker than button red for readability on white)
+    - `linkHover`: darker than link
+    - `focusRing`: visible on neutral backgrounds (often a lighter red/pink or alpha-based ring)
+- **Rationale**: This is the minimum set of tokens needed to make buttons/links/focus states reflect the new brand color globally.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria 1–3; validation rules #1–4.
+
+---
+
+**Step 3: Update dark-mode primary tokens to red (only if dark mode tokens live in the same core file)**
+- **File**: same core theme file as Step 2
+- **Action**: Update the dark palette’s primary/link/focus tokens to red shades appropriate for dark UI.
+- **Details**:
+  - If the file contains a dark block/object, update the same token set:
+    - `primary`, `primaryHover`, `primaryActive`, `primaryDisabled`
+    - `onPrimary`
+    - `link`, `linkHover`
+    - `focusRing`
+  - Choose a red that remains legible on dark surfaces (often slightly brighter than light-mode primary).
+- **Rationale**: Keeps branding consistent across modes while maintaining contrast.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion 4; validation rules #3–5.
+
+---
+
+**Step 4: Ensure semantic status colors remain unchanged (within the core theme file)**
+- **File**: core theme file
+- **Action**: Verify success/warning/error tokens are not modified and are not accidentally derived from `primary`.
+- **Details**:
+  - If the core file defines semantic tokens, leave them as-is.
+  - If semantic tokens reference `primary` (rare but possible), decouple them in the core file only.
+- **Rationale**: Prevents regressions where alerts/badges unintentionally become red.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion 5; validation rule #6.
+
+---
+
+**Step 5: Confirm interaction-state distinctness via token values (core file only)**
+- **File**: core theme file
+- **Action**: Ensure hover/active/disabled/focus tokens are visually distinct from base primary.
+- **Details**:
+  - `primaryHover` ≠ `primary`
+  - `primaryActive` ≠ `primaryHover`
+  - `primaryDisabled` clearly distinct (lighter/desaturated/opacity-based depending on system)
+  - `linkHover` ≠ `link`
+  - `focusRing` not identical to primary background (so it doesn’t disappear on red buttons)
+- **Rationale**: Makes hover/active/disabled/focus states clearly perceivable without touching component code.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion 2–3; validation rules #2–4.
+
+---
+
+### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY
+
+Validation is intentionally focused on confirming the **core theme file change propagates** (since we are not editing other files).
+
+1. **Token-level validation (core file)**
+   - Confirm primary/brand token is now red.
+   - Confirm hover/active/disabled/link/focus tokens exist and are updated accordingly.
+   - If dark mode exists in the same file, confirm dark tokens are updated too.
+
+2. **Propagation validation (runtime/manual)**
+   - Inspect in browser devtools computed styles:
+     - Primary button background uses the primary token and is red
+     - Links are red and hover is distinct
+     - Focus ring is visible on keyboard focus
+     - Nav active states (if tied to primary) reflect red
+
+3. **Regression validation**
+   - Check success/warning/error alerts/badges remain their semantic colors.
+
+4. **Contrast sanity checks**
+   - Primary button text vs red background is readable (AA target).
+   - Link red vs page background is readable in light and dark modes.
+
+---
+
+### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS
+
+Even though we won’t edit them, these are the places that must already be wired correctly for the core token change to propagate:
+
+- Global style/theme import: `src/main.tsx` and/or `src/App.tsx`
+- Core tokens file import: `src/styles/theme.css` (if CSS vars) or `src/theme.ts` (if ThemeProvider)
+- Dark mode toggle mechanism (only to verify): `.dark` / `[data-theme]` / theme mode switch
+
+---
+
+### 6. EDGE CASES & CONSIDERATIONS
+
+- **Focus ring on red buttons**: ensure the ring token is not the same red as the button background; use a lighter/alpha ring token in the core file.
+- **Link visited state**: if the core file defines `visited` token, ensure it remains readable and not confusingly close to default link red.
+- **Disabled state**: ensure disabled doesn’t look like hover/active; keep it clearly muted.
+- **Error vs brand red**: error semantic red may be close to brand red; keep error tokens unchanged to avoid semantic confusion.
+
+---
+
+### 7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
+
+- Edit **only the centralized/core theme tokens file** (the source of truth).
+- DO NOT include unit tests (handled separately).
+- Do not hardcode red in individual components.
+- Preserve semantic status colors (success/warning/error).
+- Maintain existing conventions and backward compatibility.
