  "llmTaskExplanation": "Update the application’s UI color theme so that the primary brand color is red. This typically means changing the design system/theme configuration (e.g., primary color token) and ensuring all components that rely on theme tokens (buttons, links, active states, focus rings, nav highlights, etc.) reflect the new red palette consistently. Implementation should prefer updating a single source of truth (theme/tokens) rather than hard-coding colors in individual components. After updating the theme, verify key screens/components render with the new primary red color and that contrast/accessibility remains acceptable.",
  "validations": [],
  "unitTests": [],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Use the existing theme/tokens system already present in the repo (e.g., ThemeProvider, CSS variables, Tailwind config, MUI/Chakra theme, etc.).",
    "Existing test framework in the repo (e.g., Jest/Vitest) and UI test utilities (e.g., React Testing Library) for style assertions/snapshots."
  ],
  "security": [
    "No security-sensitive changes expected; ensure no secrets/config are introduced while changing theme values.",
    "Do not log user data or introduce telemetry as part of a theme change."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Prefer token/theme-level changes to avoid increasing bundle size via duplicated inline styles.",
    "Avoid adding large new color libraries/assets; keep changes minimal and within existing styling system."
  ],
  "businessContext": "This is a branding/visual identity update: the product’s primary brand color should be red across the UI. Consistency is important so users recognize primary actions and accents. The change should be centralized in the theme to reduce maintenance and ensure uniform appearance.",
  "otherNotes": "If the app has multiple themes/tenants/white-labeling, ensure the default theme is updated (or add a red variant behind an existing theme switch). If design tokens include multiple shades (50-900), update the full palette so hover/active states can derive from adjacent shades. Ensure focus outlines remain visible (especially if they use the primary color).",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The project has a centralized theming mechanism (theme object, design tokens, CSS variables, or Tailwind config) that controls primary/brand colors.",

      "assumption": "The repo includes a frontend UI where theme changes are visible and testable."

  "llmOpenQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "Should the new red be applied only to the primary/brand color, or should it also replace other accents (e.g., secondary/accent) to make the overall theme predominantly red?",
      "answer":"change core color theme file"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you have a specific red to match (hex value or brand palette), or is a standard red acceptable?",

  "promptForAider": "## Task: Change color theme to red\n\nUpdate the app’s global theme so the **primary/brand color** is red, applied consistently across UI components.\n\n### Implementation\n- Find the centralized theme/tokens source (ThemeProvider/theme object, CSS variables, Tailwind config, etc.).\n- Update the **primary/brand** palette/token(s) to a red palette (include shades for hover/active if the system supports it).\n- Ensure components consume tokens (no hard-coded old primary color). Only touch individual components if they are not token-driven.\n- If dark mode exists, update the dark theme’s primary red variant too.\n\n### Validations / Checks\n- Primary token is defined and used globally.\n- Hover/active/disabled states remain distinct.\n- Contrast/readability does not regress.\n- Build + lint + tests pass.\n\n### Unit tests (use existing test stack)\n- Assert theme exports primary token set to red.\n- Render a primary button/link and assert it uses the theme primary color (style assertion or snapshot).\n- Assert hover/active styles differ from default.\n- If dark mode exists: toggling dark mode applies the dark red variant.\n- Regression: semantic error color remains tied to error token, not unintentionally changed.\n\n### Acceptance criteria\n- Primary actions and accents render in red.\n- Interactive states remain clear.\n- Dark mode (if present) uses appropriate red.\n- CI checks pass.\n\nPlease implement with minimal, centralized changes and add/update tests accordingly."
