+
+**Detailed Explanation**: 
+Implement a maximum length constraint of **7 letters** for the `firstName` field in the student registration flow, enforced both client-side (student registration form UI) and server-side (backend Zod schema validation) to prevent invalid data from being submitted or persisted.
+
+Rule clarification (from resolved questions):
+- The limit is **letters only** (not total characters). Non-letter characters (spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, accents, etc.) do not count toward the 7-letter limit unless they are considered letters by Unicode letter classification.
+- UX should **hard-stop**: prevent the user from entering/pasting a value that would exceed 7 letters.
+
+Backend: Update `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts` to validate that `firstName` contains **<= 7 letters**. This likely requires a custom Zod refinement (e.g., count Unicode letters via `\p{L}`) rather than `.max(7)` on raw string length. Return a clear message like `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.
+
+Frontend: Update the Student Registration form component to enforce the same rule in form validation and input handling. Because HTML `maxLength` limits total characters (not letters), implement an `onChange`/input handler that blocks paste/typing when the resulting value would exceed 7 letters, while still allowing non-letter characters. Show a clear inline validation message and block submission when invalid.
+
+Add/adjust unit tests in both backend and frontend to cover the new letter-count constraint, including paste behavior and boundary cases.
+
+**Business Context**:
+Student registration requires a constrained first name length of max 7 **letters** (letters-only count). This is likely a business rule for formatting, ID card printing, or legacy system constraints. The rule must be consistent across UI and API to prevent invalid records.
+
+**Aider instructions**:
+## Task: Limit student registration `firstName` to max 7 **letters** (frontend + backend)
+
+### Business rule (authoritative)
+- `firstName` must contain **no more than 7 letters**.
+- **Count only letters** (Unicode letters). Non-letter characters (spaces/hyphens/apostrophes/etc.) do **not** count toward the 7.
+- UX: **hard-stop paste/typing** so the input value cannot end up with > 7 letters.
+
+### What to change
+#### Backend
+- Update `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`
+  - Replace/augment any `.max(7)` raw-length check with a Zod `refine`/`superRefine` that counts letters and enforces `<= 7`.
+  - Error message: `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.
+
+#### Frontend
+- Update `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+  - Mirror the same letter-count validation.
+  - Implement hard-stop behavior for typing/paste (note: HTML `maxLength` is not sufficient because it limits total characters, not letters).
+  - Show inline error and block submit when invalid.
+- If validators are centralized, update `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` to include a reusable `firstName` letters-only max-7 validator.
+
+### Validations
+- required
+- <= 7 letters (letters-only count)
+- 7 letters accepted; 8 letters rejected
+- backend returns 4xx validation error for invalid payload
+
+### Tests (no mocks)
+- Backend Vitest (`backend/src/schemas/student.schema.test.ts`):
+  - accepts exactly 7 letters ("ABCDEFG")
+  - accepts 7 letters + non-letters ("ABC-DEFG")
+  - rejects 8 letters ("ABCDEFGH") with message mentioning max 7 letters
+  - rejects empty string
+- Frontend Vitest + RTL (`StudentRegistrationForm.test.tsx`):
+  - hard-stop paste/typing so value never exceeds 7 letters
+  - shows inline error + blocks submit when > 7 letters
+  - allows submit when 7 letters and other required fields valid
+
+### Conventions
+- Follow `docs/coding-preferences.md`: arrow functions only, consolidated exports, co-located tests, no mocks.
+- Keep error copy consistent between FE/BE.

+
+## SCOPE DEFINITION
+
+### IN SCOPE
+
+1. Add backend validation to reject `firstName` containing more than 7 letters (letters-only count).
+2. Add frontend validation to prevent submission when `firstName` contains more than 7 letters.
+3. Implement frontend hard-stop behavior for typing/paste so the input value cannot exceed 7 letters (letters-only count).
+4. Add/adjust backend and frontend tests to cover the new letter-count constraint and hard-stop paste behavior.
+
+### OUT OF SCOPE
+
+1. Changing constraints for lastName or other fields.
+2. Data migration or retroactive cleanup of existing student records with long first names.
+3. Adding new authentication/authorization features.
+4. Changing API endpoints or response shapes beyond validation error messaging already used.
+
+---
+
+## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
+
+1. Given I am on the student registration page, when I type or paste a First Name that would result in more than 7 letters, then the input hard-stops so the field value does not exceed 7 letters and I see a validation message indicating the maximum is 7 letters.
+2. Given I attempt to submit the registration form with a First Name containing more than 7 letters, then I cannot submit the form and I see an inline validation message indicating the maximum is 7 letters.
+3. Given I submit the registration form with a First Name containing 7 letters (and all other required fields valid), then the form submits successfully.
+4. Given a client sends an API request with `firstName` containing more than 7 letters, when the backend validates the payload, then the request is rejected with a 4xx validation error response and the student is not created/updated.
+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
+
+### Dependencies & Technologies
+
+1. Backend: zod (already in backend dependencies) for schema validation (use refine/superRefine for letter counting).
+2. Frontend: existing form validation utilities and/or zod (already in frontend dependencies) to mirror backend rule.
+3. Frontend tests: @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, vitest (already in frontend devDependencies).
+4. Backend tests: vitest (already in backend devDependencies).
+
+### Validation Rules
+
+1. firstName is required and must be a string with length >= 1 (after trimming if trimming is already part of existing behavior; otherwise validate raw value).
+2. firstName must contain at most 7 letters (Unicode letters). Count only letters; non-letter characters do not count toward the 7-letter limit.
+3. Boundary: firstName with exactly 7 letters is accepted (even if it includes additional non-letter characters).
+4. Boundary: firstName with 8 letters is rejected with a clear error message mentioning max 7 letters.
+5. Frontend input must hard-stop: typing/pasting must not allow the field value to end up with > 7 letters.
+6. Frontend form submission must be blocked when firstName would violate the 7-letter rule, and an inline error must be displayed.
+7. Backend API must return a 4xx validation error (not 5xx) when firstName contains > 7 letters.

+4. `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`
+5. `docs/coding-preferences.md`
+6. `docs/folder-structure.md`
+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS
+
+1. The 7-letter limit counts Unicode letters (e.g., using a \p{L} regex) and ignores non-letter characters for the count.
+2. Student registration UI is implemented under `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/` and is used by the `/students/new` route.
+3. Backend uses `StudentSchema` to validate incoming create/update student requests, so adding a letter-count refinement will enforce the rule at the API boundary.
+4. Frontend validation is either Zod-based or uses utilities in `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`; the change should align with existing patterns discovered in-repo.
+
+---
+
+## SUGGESTED FILE CHANGES
+
+
+1. **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Add Zod refinement to enforce `firstName` contains at most 7 letters (letters-only count), with a clear error message.
+
+2. **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.test.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Add Vitest coverage for letter-count boundary and rejection cases, including values with non-letter characters that should not count toward the limit.
+
+3. **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: Enforce 7-letter limit in UI validation and implement hard-stop typing/paste so the value cannot exceed 7 letters.
+
+4. **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.test.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: Add React Testing Library tests ensuring hard-stop paste/typing and that submission is blocked with an inline error when the value contains > 7 letters.
+
+5. **File**: `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`
+   **Rationale**: If centralized validators exist, add/update a firstName validator (letters-only count <= 7) and reuse it in the form.
+
+---
+
+## ADDITIONAL NOTES
+
+Because the requirement is "7 letters" (not 7 characters), do not rely solely on HTML `maxLength` or Zod `.max(7)` on raw string length. Implement a shared/duplicated letter-count helper (Unicode-aware, e.g., using `\p{L}`) in both frontend and backend, or implement equivalent logic in each layer.
+
+UX requirement: hard-stop paste/typing so the value cannot end up with > 7 letters.
+
+Ensure error copy is user-friendly and consistent between frontend and backend. Follow repo conventions: arrow functions only, exports consolidated at end of file, and co-locate tests with source. No mocking in tests per project testing strategy.
+

+
+## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM PLANNING NODE
+
+The following comprehensive plan was created by the planning node. Follow this plan to implement the feature:
+
+### 1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS
+
+- **Backend validation** is handled with **Zod** schemas under `backend/src/schemas/`. The relevant file is `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`, which currently validates `firstName` as required (e.g., `z.string().min(1, ...)`) but does **not** correctly enforce “max 7 letters” (and must not rely on `.max(7)` because that counts characters, not letters).
+- **Backend error behavior** (4xx vs 5xx, and how Zod errors are surfaced) must be **verified in-repo**:
+  - Identify where request payload validation happens (route handler / controller / middleware).
+  - Confirm that Zod validation failures are translated into a **4xx** response and that the **message** can be made to include `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.
+- **Frontend** is a Next.js App Router app:
+  - `/students/new` route entry: `frontend/src/app/students/new/page.tsx`
+  - Form component: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Frontend validation architecture must be confirmed**:
+  - Check whether the form uses `react-hook-form`, a Zod resolver, custom validators, or a homegrown form state.
+  - Check `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` to see existing patterns (function validators vs zod schemas) and reuse them.
+- **Shared contract check**:
+  - Verify whether the frontend imports any shared schema/types (e.g., from a shared package, generated types, or API client validators). If so, ensure the new rule is applied consistently and doesn’t conflict.
+- **Repo conventions** from `docs/coding-preferences.md` must be followed:
+  - Arrow functions only
+  - Consolidated exports at end of file
+  - Co-located tests exist in repo (but tests are implemented in a separate node; this plan must still outline required test updates).
+
+---
+
+### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+
+Implement the same authoritative business rule in both layers:
+
+1. **Single rule definition per layer (to prevent drift within that layer)**:
+   - Backend: define a local helper `countUnicodeLetters()` and a constant error message string used by the Zod refinement.
+   - Frontend: define a local helper and constant error message string in `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` (or wherever validators live), and reuse it in the form.
+
+2. **Backend enforcement (authoritative)**:
+   - Update `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts` to enforce: `countLetters(firstName) <= 7`.
+   - Use Zod `refine`/`superRefine` with Unicode letter counting via `\p{L}`.
+   - Ensure the API returns a **4xx** on validation failure and includes the intended message.
+
+3. **Frontend UX enforcement (hard-stop + inline error + submit blocking)**:
+   - Implement **hard-stop** so the input value can never end up with > 7 letters:
+     - Prefer **sanitizing/truncating letters-only** on paste/typing to fit the 7-letter limit while preserving non-letters (more user-friendly than fully blocking).
+     - Additionally, show an inline message when the user attempts to exceed the limit (so the “hard-stop” doesn’t feel like the UI is broken).
+   - Also implement **defensive validation** on submit (and optionally on blur) to block submission if invalid (in case of browser/IME edge cases).
+
+4. **IME/composition safety**:
+   - Avoid breaking IME input by not enforcing truncation mid-composition.
+   - Track composition state and apply enforcement on `compositionend` (and as a fallback in `onChange` when not composing).
+
+5. **Tests are in-scope (but not written in this node)**:
+   - This plan must explicitly enumerate the backend and frontend test cases required by the task so the next node can implement them.
+
+---
+
+### 3. COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
+
+**Step 1: Confirm existing trimming/normalization behavior (backend + frontend)**
+- **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts` (and any shared schema utilities it imports)
+- **Action**: Inspect how `firstName` is currently validated/normalized.
+- **Details**:
+  - Determine whether the schema uses `.trim()` or preprocessors.
+  - Decide and document the concrete behavior:
+    - If `.trim()` is already used for names, keep it and count letters on the trimmed value.
+    - If not used, do not introduce trimming silently unless consistent with existing patterns; still count letters on the raw value.
+- **Rationale**: Requirements mention trimming “if already part of existing behavior”; we must be consistent to avoid unexpected behavior changes.
+- **Addresses**: Validation rule #1 consistency; reduces ambiguity.
+
+**Step 2: Add backend Unicode letter counting helper + constant error message**
+- **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`
+- **Action**: Add a small helper and a message constant used by the schema.
+- **Details**:
+  - Implement `const countUnicodeLetters = (value: string) => (value.match(/\p{L}/gu) ?? []).length`
+  - Add `const FIRST_NAME_MAX_LETTERS_ERROR = "First name must contain at most 7 letters"`
+  - Keep these near the schema definition (module-local), and reuse the constant in the refinement.
+- **Rationale**: Avoid duplicated regex logic and ensure consistent error copy within backend.
+- **Addresses**: Backend rule enforcement; “prevent drift” within backend.
+
+**Step 3: Enforce backend max-7-letters via Zod refinement**
+- **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`
+- **Action**: Update `firstName` schema to enforce `<= 7` letters (Unicode letters only).
+- **Details**:
+  - Keep required validation (e.g., `.min(1, "First name is required")`).
+  - Add `.refine((v) => countUnicodeLetters(v) <= 7, { message: FIRST_NAME_MAX_LETTERS_ERROR })`
+  - If the schema uses `.trim()`, ensure the refinement runs on the trimmed value (i.e., apply `.trim()` before `.refine()`).
+- **Rationale**: `.max(7)` is incorrect for “letters-only”; refinement is required.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion #4; validation rules #2–#4.
+
+**Step 4: Verify backend request validation returns 4xx and surfaces message**
+- **File**: (repo-dependent) likely request handler/middleware files where `StudentSchema.parse()` / `safeParse()` is used
+- **Action**: Confirm and, if needed, adjust error handling so invalid `firstName` yields a **4xx** with the intended message.
+- **Details**:
+  - Locate where student create/update endpoints validate payloads.
+  - Confirm Zod errors map to 400/422 (not 500).
+  - Confirm the response includes field-level errors or at least includes the message `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.
+  - If the current error formatter drops refine messages, adjust formatting to include them (without changing response shape beyond existing conventions).
+- **Rationale**: The task explicitly requires a 4xx validation error and clear message.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion #4; validation rule #7.
+
+**Step 5: Confirm frontend form validation architecture and where to place validator**
+- **File**: 
+  - `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+  - `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`
+- **Action**: Inspect how validation is currently done and decide the integration point.
+- **Details**:
+  - If `validators.ts` already exports field validators, add a `firstName` validator there.
+  - If the form uses Zod schema locally, either:
+    - add a reusable helper in `validators.ts` and use it in the Zod `refine`, or
+    - add a dedicated Zod schema for `firstName` in `validators.ts` and import it.
+- **Rationale**: Avoid inventing a new validation style; align with existing patterns.
+- **Addresses**: Validation feedback about underspecified architecture.
+
+**Step 6: Add frontend Unicode letter counting + validator + message constant**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`
+- **Action**: Add reusable helper(s) and a validator for max 7 letters.
+- **Details**:
+  - Add `countUnicodeLetters()` using `/\p{L}/gu`.
+  - Add `FIRST_NAME_MAX_LETTERS_ERROR = "First name must contain at most 7 letters"`.
+  - Add a validator function (or zod schema) that checks:
+    - required (existing required rule)
+    - `countUnicodeLetters(value) <= 7`
+  - Export via consolidated export block at end of file.
+- **Rationale**: Centralize logic and error copy within frontend; reuse in form and tests.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria #1–#3; prevents drift within FE.
+
+**Step 7: Implement hard-stop behavior by sanitizing to max 7 letters (preserve non-letters)**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Action**: Update the `firstName` input handlers so the value cannot exceed 7 letters.
+- **Details** (commit to a concrete behavior):
+  - Implement a helper in the component (or imported from validators if appropriate):  
+    `const clampToMaxLetters = (value: string, maxLetters: number) => string`
+    - Iterate through the string by Unicode codepoints (JS string iteration is codepoint-aware for most cases) and:
+      - Count letters using `\p{L}` per character
+      - Append characters until letter count reaches 7
+      - After reaching 7 letters, still allow appending **non-letter** characters?  
+        - **Decision**: Yes, allow non-letters even after 7 letters (since they don’t count).  
+        - But if the user tries to add an additional letter beyond 7, that letter is dropped.
+  - Wire it into input updates:
+    - Maintain `firstName` as controlled value (or via form library controller).
+    - On `onChange`, compute `next = clampToMaxLetters(e.target.value, 7)` and set that as the value.
+    - Track `lastAttemptExceeded` (boolean) to show the inline message when clamping removed letters.
+      - Example: if `next !== e.target.value`, set an error state/message.
+  - **State management clarity**:
+    - You do not need to “revert to previous value” if you always clamp; the clamped value becomes the new value.
+    - Store the current value in the form state; store a separate UI flag for “user attempted to exceed”.
+- **Rationale**: This satisfies “hard-stop” for typing and paste while being user-friendly (paste results in a best-effort value rather than nothing).
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion #1; validation rule #5.
+
+**Step 8: Handle paste explicitly (optional but recommended)**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Action**: Ensure paste is also hard-stopped and triggers the same message.
+- **Details**:
+  - If using controlled `onChange` clamping, paste is already handled.
+  - Optionally add `onPaste` to:
+    - read clipboard text
+    - compute the would-be value
+    - set clamped value
+    - prevent default paste to avoid flicker
+  - Keep behavior consistent with typing.
+- **Rationale**: Some browsers/input setups may briefly show pasted content before React state updates; explicit paste handling can improve UX.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion #1 (paste behavior).
+
+**Step 9: IME/composition-safe enforcement**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Action**: Avoid clamping mid-composition; enforce on composition end.
+- **Details**:
+  - Track `isComposing` via `onCompositionStart` / `onCompositionEnd`.
+  - While `isComposing` is true:
+    - Allow `onChange` to update value without clamping (or clamp only non-destructively if proven safe in the codebase).
+  - On `compositionend`:
+    - Clamp the final value and set the “attempt exceeded” message if clamping occurred.
+- **Rationale**: Prevent breaking CJK/IME input while still enforcing the rule.
+- **Addresses**: Validation feedback about IME feasibility; acceptance criterion #1 robustness.
+
+**Step 10: Block submit and show inline error when invalid (defense-in-depth)**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Action**: Ensure form submission cannot proceed if `firstName` violates the rule.
+- **Details**:
+  - Use the validator from `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` in the submit handler (or form library validation schema).
+  - If invalid:
+    - set field error state
+    - render inline error message: `First name must contain at most 7 letters`
+    - do not call the API
+  - Ensure required validation still works (empty string rejected).
+- **Rationale**: Even with hard-stop, defensive validation is required for edge cases and programmatic submission.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria #2 and #3; validation rules #1–#6.
+
+**Step 11: Confirm route wiring uses updated form**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/app/students/new/page.tsx`
+- **Action**: Verify the page renders the updated `StudentRegistrationForm` and no alternate path bypasses the new logic.
+- **Details**:
+  - Ensure no duplicate firstName input exists elsewhere.
+  - Ensure props don’t override validation/handlers.
+- **Rationale**: Ensures the change is active in the actual user flow.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria #1–#3 end-to-end.
+
+**Step 12: Outline required test updates (implemented in separate node)**
+- **File**: 
+  - `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.test.ts`
+  - `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.test.tsx`
+- **Action**: Add/adjust tests to cover the new rule and hard-stop behavior.
+- **Details** (explicit required cases):
+  - Backend Vitest:
+    - accepts exactly 7 letters: `"ABCDEFG"`
+    - accepts 7 letters + non-letters: `"ABC-DEFG"` (7 letters, 1 hyphen)
+    - rejects 8 letters: `"ABCDEFGH"` with message containing `First name must contain at most 7 letters`
+    - rejects empty string
+  - Frontend Vitest + RTL:
+    - typing hard-stop: attempt to type 8th letter results in value still having only 7 letters
+    - paste hard-stop: paste `"ABCDEFGH"` results in clamped value with 7 letters (and message shown)
+    - inline error shown when user attempts to exceed 7 letters (or when validation runs)
+    - submit blocked when invalid; submit allowed when 7 letters and other required fields valid
+- **Rationale**: Tests are in-scope; this plan must specify them even if implemented later.
+- **Addresses**: Task scope + acceptance criteria verification.
+
+**Step 13: Check for shared API client schemas/types and update if present**
+- **File**: repo-dependent (e.g., `frontend/src/lib/api/*`, shared `packages/*`, generated types)
+- **Action**: If the frontend uses a shared schema/type for student payloads, update it or ensure it remains compatible.
+- **Details**:
+  - Search for `StudentSchema` usage in frontend or shared packages.
+  - If a shared Zod schema exists, consider reusing it (or ensure both sides implement the same rule).
+- **Rationale**: Prevent mismatches where FE allows something BE rejects (or vice versa).
+- **Addresses**: Validation feedback about shared contracts.
+
+**Step 14: Ensure conventions and copy consistency**
+- **File**: all modified files
+- **Action**: Ensure code style and message consistency.
+- **Details**:
+  - Arrow functions only
+  - Consolidated exports at end
+  - Use the same exact error string in FE and BE (per-layer constant)
+- **Rationale**: Avoid lint/style failures and copy drift.
+- **Addresses**: Conventions + “keep error copy consistent”.
+
+---
+
+### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY
+
+- **Backend (authoritative)**:
+  - Zod refinement counts Unicode letters via `\p{L}` and enforces `<= 7`.
+  - Confirm validation failures return **4xx** and include the refine message.
+- **Frontend (UX + defense-in-depth)**:
+  - **Hard-stop** via clamping/sanitization ensures the input value cannot contain > 7 letters after any user action (typing/paste).
+  - **Inline messaging** appears when clamping occurs and/or when validation runs.
+  - **Submit blocking** re-validates and prevents API calls if invalid (covers edge cases like IME, programmatic value setting, or browser quirks).
+- **Consistency**:
+  - Same error copy string used across FE and BE (as constants per layer).
+
+---
+
+### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS
+
+- **Backend**:
+  - `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts` is the validation boundary for student create/update payloads.
+  - Request validation middleware/controller must parse with this schema and map failures to 4xx.
+- **Frontend**:
+  - `StudentRegistrationForm.tsx` is the UI entry point for student creation.
+  - `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` (or existing validation module) is the shared frontend validation source.
+  - `/students/new` route must render the updated form.
+- **Potential shared contract**:
+  - If a shared schema/types package exists, it must be checked and updated or consciously left duplicated with parity.
+
+---
+
+### 6. EDGE CASES & CONSIDERATIONS
+
+- **Unicode letters**: `\p{L}` counts accented letters and non-Latin scripts as letters (desired).
+- **Non-letters**: spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, punctuation, digits do not count toward 7 and should remain allowed.
+- **After reaching 7 letters**:
+  - Additional **letters** are dropped (hard-stop).
+  - Additional **non-letters** are allowed (since they don’t increase letter count).
+- **Paste**:
+  - Pasting long strings should result in a clamped value (letters limited to 7) rather than rejecting the paste entirely.
+- **IME/composition**:
+  - Do not clamp mid-composition; clamp on `compositionend`.
+- **Empty string**:
+  - Still invalid due to required rule.
+- **Backend/Frontend mismatch risk**:
+  - Must ensure both count letters the same way (`\p{L}` with `u` flag).
+- **Runtime support**:
+  - Unicode property escapes require modern JS runtimes; confirm Node version and frontend build target support it (likely yes). If not, plan fallback (but only if repo constraints demand it).
+
+---
+
+### 7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
+
+- Focus ONLY on core feature implementation.
+- DO NOT write unit test code in this node (tests are implemented separately), but **do** keep the explicit test plan (Step 12) since tests are in-scope.
+- Follow existing codebase conventions and patterns:
+  - Arrow functions only
+  - Consolidated exports at end of file
+  - Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing form/validation architecture
+- Ensure type safety and code quality.
+- Maintain backward compatibility where applicable, except for the intended new validation rule.
+- Keep error copy consistent between FE/BE: `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.

+
+## Key Patterns
+
+- **app/** → pages, **components/** → UI
+- tests: `*.test.tsx` co-located with source
+- styles: SCSS modules (`*.module.scss`) per component
+- ui components: `Component/` folder w/ Component.tsx + .module.scss + .test.tsx + .example.tsx
+- api: `/lib/api.ts` single source for backend calls
+- env: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for backend endpoint
+
+
+2. `docs/coding-preferences.md`
+---FILE_CONTENT---
+- Function Syntax: Use arrow functions for all function definitions. Do not use the function keyword.
+
+- Export Pattern: Consolidate all exports into a single block at the end of the file. Do not use inline export keywords for individual variables, classes, or functions.
+
+- Testing Strategy: Zero Mocking: Do not use mocks, stubs, or spies in unit tests.
+
+  - Real Execution: All tests must call the actual implementation of functions and dependencies.
+
+  - Environment: Treat unit tests as functional integration tests. Since tests run against a dedicated database and target configuration, side effects are permitted.
+
+- No Emojis in messages while generating code
+
+- file naming conventions as small letters separated by hyphen
+
+- export types separately like `export type`, also import too

+
+**Detailed Explanation**: 
+Implement a maximum length constraint of **7 letters** for the `firstName` field in the student registration flow, enforced both client-side (student registration form UI) and server-side (backend Zod schema validation) to prevent invalid data from being submitted or persisted.
+
+Rule clarification (from resolved questions):
+- The limit is **letters only** (not total characters). Non-letter characters (spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, accents, etc.) do not count toward the 7-letter limit unless they are considered letters by Unicode letter classification.
+- UX should **hard-stop**: prevent the user from entering/pasting a value that would exceed 7 letters.
+
+Backend: Update `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts` to validate that `firstName` contains **<= 7 letters**. This likely requires a custom Zod refinement (e.g., count Unicode letters via `\p{L}`) rather than `.max(7)` on raw string length. Return a clear message like `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.
+
+Frontend: Update the Student Registration form component to enforce the same rule in form validation and input handling. Because HTML `maxLength` limits total characters (not letters), implement an `onChange`/input handler that blocks paste/typing when the resulting value would exceed 7 letters, while still allowing non-letter characters. Show a clear inline validation message and block submission when invalid.
+
+Add/adjust unit tests in both backend and frontend to cover the new letter-count constraint, including paste behavior and boundary cases.
+
+**Business Context**:
+Student registration requires a constrained first name length of max 7 **letters** (letters-only count). This is likely a business rule for formatting, ID card printing, or legacy system constraints. The rule must be consistent across UI and API to prevent invalid records.
+
+**Aider instructions**:
+## Task: Limit student registration `firstName` to max 7 **letters** (frontend + backend)
+
+### Business rule (authoritative)
+- `firstName` must contain **no more than 7 letters**.
+- **Count only letters** (Unicode letters). Non-letter characters (spaces/hyphens/apostrophes/etc.) do **not** count toward the 7.
+- UX: **hard-stop paste/typing** so the input value cannot end up with > 7 letters.
+
+### What to change
+#### Backend
+- Update `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`
+  - Replace/augment any `.max(7)` raw-length check with a Zod `refine`/`superRefine` that counts letters and enforces `<= 7`.
+  - Error message: `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.
+
+#### Frontend
+- Update `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+  - Mirror the same letter-count validation.
+  - Implement hard-stop behavior for typing/paste (note: HTML `maxLength` is not sufficient because it limits total characters, not letters).
+  - Show inline error and block submit when invalid.
+- If validators are centralized, update `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` to include a reusable `firstName` letters-only max-7 validator.
+
+### Validations
+- required
+- <= 7 letters (letters-only count)
+- 7 letters accepted; 8 letters rejected
+- backend returns 4xx validation error for invalid payload
+
+### Tests (no mocks)
+- Backend Vitest (`backend/src/schemas/student.schema.test.ts`):
+  - accepts exactly 7 letters ("ABCDEFG")
+  - accepts 7 letters + non-letters ("ABC-DEFG")
+  - rejects 8 letters ("ABCDEFGH") with message mentioning max 7 letters
+  - rejects empty string
+- Frontend Vitest + RTL (`StudentRegistrationForm.test.tsx`):
+  - hard-stop paste/typing so value never exceeds 7 letters
+  - shows inline error + blocks submit when > 7 letters
+  - allows submit when 7 letters and other required fields valid
+
+### Conventions
+- Follow `docs/coding-preferences.md`: arrow functions only, consolidated exports, co-located tests, no mocks.
+- Keep error copy consistent between FE/BE.
+
+
+---
+
+## SCOPE DEFINITION
+
+### IN SCOPE
+
+1. Add backend validation to reject `firstName` containing more than 7 letters (letters-only count).
+2. Add frontend validation to prevent submission when `firstName` contains more than 7 letters.
+3. Implement frontend hard-stop behavior for typing/paste so the input value cannot exceed 7 letters (letters-only count).
+4. Add/adjust backend and frontend tests to cover the new letter-count constraint and hard-stop paste behavior.
+
+### OUT OF SCOPE
+
+1. Changing constraints for lastName or other fields.
+2. Data migration or retroactive cleanup of existing student records with long first names.
+3. Adding new authentication/authorization features.
+4. Changing API endpoints or response shapes beyond validation error messaging already used.
+
+---
+
+## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
+
+1. Given I am on the student registration page, when I type or paste a First Name that would result in more than 7 letters, then the input hard-stops so the field value does not exceed 7 letters and I see a validation message indicating the maximum is 7 letters.
+2. Given I attempt to submit the registration form with a First Name containing more than 7 letters, then I cannot submit the form and I see an inline validation message indicating the maximum is 7 letters.
+3. Given I submit the registration form with a First Name containing 7 letters (and all other required fields valid), then the form submits successfully.
+4. Given a client sends an API request with `firstName` containing more than 7 letters, when the backend validates the payload, then the request is rejected with a 4xx validation error response and the student is not created/updated.
+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
+
+### Dependencies & Technologies
+
+1. Backend: zod (already in backend dependencies) for schema validation (use refine/superRefine for letter counting).
+2. Frontend: existing form validation utilities and/or zod (already in frontend dependencies) to mirror backend rule.
+3. Frontend tests: @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, vitest (already in frontend devDependencies).
+4. Backend tests: vitest (already in backend devDependencies).
+
+### Validation Rules
+
+1. firstName is required and must be a string with length >= 1 (after trimming if trimming is already part of existing behavior; otherwise validate raw value).
+2. firstName must contain at most 7 letters (Unicode letters). Count only letters; non-letter characters do not count toward the 7-letter limit.
+3. Boundary: firstName with exactly 7 letters is accepted (even if it includes additional non-letter characters).
+4. Boundary: firstName with 8 letters is rejected with a clear error message mentioning max 7 letters.
+5. Frontend input must hard-stop: typing/pasting must not allow the field value to end up with > 7 letters.
+6. Frontend form submission must be blocked when firstName would violate the 7-letter rule, and an inline error must be displayed.
+7. Backend API must return a 4xx validation error (not 5xx) when firstName contains > 7 letters.

+4. `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`
+5. `docs/coding-preferences.md`
+6. `docs/folder-structure.md`
+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS
+
+1. The 7-letter limit counts Unicode letters (e.g., using a \p{L} regex) and ignores non-letter characters for the count.
+2. Student registration UI is implemented under `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/` and is used by the `/students/new` route.
+3. Backend uses `StudentSchema` to validate incoming create/update student requests, so adding a letter-count refinement will enforce the rule at the API boundary.
+4. Frontend validation is either Zod-based or uses utilities in `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`; the change should align with existing patterns discovered in-repo.
+
+---
+
+## SUGGESTED FILE CHANGES
+
+
+1. **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Add Zod refinement to enforce `firstName` contains at most 7 letters (letters-only count), with a clear error message.
+
+2. **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.test.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Add Vitest coverage for letter-count boundary and rejection cases, including values with non-letter characters that should not count toward the limit.
+
+3. **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: Enforce 7-letter limit in UI validation and implement hard-stop typing/paste so the value cannot exceed 7 letters.
+
+4. **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.test.tsx`
+   **Rationale**: Add React Testing Library tests ensuring hard-stop paste/typing and that submission is blocked with an inline error when the value contains > 7 letters.
+
+5. **File**: `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`
+   **Rationale**: If centralized validators exist, add/update a firstName validator (letters-only count <= 7) and reuse it in the form.
+
+---
+
+## ADDITIONAL NOTES
+
+Because the requirement is "7 letters" (not 7 characters), do not rely solely on HTML `maxLength` or Zod `.max(7)` on raw string length. Implement a shared/duplicated letter-count helper (Unicode-aware, e.g., using `\p{L}`) in both frontend and backend, or implement equivalent logic in each layer.
+
+UX requirement: hard-stop paste/typing so the value cannot end up with > 7 letters.
+
+Ensure error copy is user-friendly and consistent between frontend and backend. Follow repo conventions: arrow functions only, exports consolidated at end of file, and co-locate tests with source. No mocking in tests per project testing strategy.

+
+## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM PLANNING NODE
+
+The following comprehensive plan was created by the planning node. Follow this plan to implement the feature:
+
+### 1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS
+
+- **Backend validation** is handled with **Zod** schemas under `backend/src/schemas/`. The relevant file is `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`, which currently validates `firstName` as required (e.g., `z.string().min(1, ...)`) but does **not** correctly enforce “max 7 letters” (and must not rely on `.max(7)` because that counts characters, not letters).
+- **Backend error behavior** (4xx vs 5xx, and how Zod errors are surfaced) must be **verified in-repo**:
+  - Identify where request payload validation happens (route handler / controller / middleware).
+  - Confirm that Zod validation failures are translated into a **4xx** response and that the **message** can be made to include `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.
+- **Frontend** is a Next.js App Router app:
+  - `/students/new` route entry: `frontend/src/app/students/new/page.tsx`
+  - Form component: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Frontend validation architecture must be confirmed**:
+  - Check whether the form uses `react-hook-form`, a Zod resolver, custom validators, or a homegrown form state.
+  - Check `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` to see existing patterns (function validators vs zod schemas) and reuse them.
+- **Shared contract check**:
+  - Verify whether the frontend imports any shared schema/types (e.g., from a shared package, generated types, or API client validators). If so, ensure the new rule is applied consistently and doesn’t conflict.
+- **Repo conventions** from `docs/coding-preferences.md` must be followed:
+  - Arrow functions only
+  - Consolidated exports at end of file
+  - Co-located tests exist in repo (but tests are implemented in a separate node; this plan must still outline required test updates).
+
+---
+
+### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+
+Implement the same authoritative business rule in both layers:
+
+1. **Single rule definition per layer (to prevent drift within that layer)**:
+   - Backend: define a local helper `countUnicodeLetters()` and a constant error message string used by the Zod refinement.
+   - Frontend: define a local helper and constant error message string in `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` (or wherever validators live), and reuse it in the form.
+
+2. **Backend enforcement (authoritative)**:
+   - Update `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts` to enforce: `countLetters(firstName) <= 7`.
+   - Use Zod `refine`/`superRefine` with Unicode letter counting via `\p{L}`.
+   - Ensure the API returns a **4xx** on validation failure and includes the intended message.
+
+3. **Frontend UX enforcement (hard-stop + inline error + submit blocking)**:
+   - Implement **hard-stop** so the input value can never end up with > 7 letters:
+     - Prefer **sanitizing/truncating letters-only** on paste/typing to fit the 7-letter limit while preserving non-letters (more user-friendly than fully blocking).
+     - Additionally, show an inline message when the user attempts to exceed the limit (so the “hard-stop” doesn’t feel like the UI is broken).
+   - Also implement **defensive validation** on submit (and optionally on blur) to block submission if invalid (in case of browser/IME edge cases).
+
+4. **IME/composition safety**:
+   - Avoid breaking IME input by not enforcing truncation mid-composition.
+   - Track composition state and apply enforcement on `compositionend` (and as a fallback in `onChange` when not composing).
+
+5. **Tests are in-scope (but not written in this node)**:
+   - This plan must explicitly enumerate the backend and frontend test cases required by the task so the next node can implement them.
+
+---
+
+### 3. COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
+
+**Step 1: Confirm existing trimming/normalization behavior (backend + frontend)**
+- **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts` (and any shared schema utilities it imports)
+- **Action**: Inspect how `firstName` is currently validated/normalized.
+- **Details**:
+  - Determine whether the schema uses `.trim()` or preprocessors.
+  - Decide and document the concrete behavior:
+    - If `.trim()` is already used for names, keep it and count letters on the trimmed value.
+    - If not used, do not introduce trimming silently unless consistent with existing patterns; still count letters on the raw value.
+- **Rationale**: Requirements mention trimming “if already part of existing behavior”; we must be consistent to avoid unexpected behavior changes.
+- **Addresses**: Validation rule #1 consistency; reduces ambiguity.
+
+**Step 2: Add backend Unicode letter counting helper + constant error message**
+- **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`
+- **Action**: Add a small helper and a message constant used by the schema.
+- **Details**:
+  - Implement `const countUnicodeLetters = (value: string) => (value.match(/\p{L}/gu) ?? []).length`
+  - Add `const FIRST_NAME_MAX_LETTERS_ERROR = "First name must contain at most 7 letters"`
+  - Keep these near the schema definition (module-local), and reuse the constant in the refinement.
+- **Rationale**: Avoid duplicated regex logic and ensure consistent error copy within backend.
+- **Addresses**: Backend rule enforcement; “prevent drift” within backend.
+
+**Step 3: Enforce backend max-7-letters via Zod refinement**
+- **File**: `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts`
+- **Action**: Update `firstName` schema to enforce `<= 7` letters (Unicode letters only).
+- **Details**:
+  - Keep required validation (e.g., `.min(1, "First name is required")`).
+  - Add `.refine((v) => countUnicodeLetters(v) <= 7, { message: FIRST_NAME_MAX_LETTERS_ERROR })`
+  - If the schema uses `.trim()`, ensure the refinement runs on the trimmed value (i.e., apply `.trim()` before `.refine()`).
+- **Rationale**: `.max(7)` is incorrect for “letters-only”; refinement is required.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion #4; validation rules #2–#4.
+
+**Step 4: Verify backend request validation returns 4xx and surfaces message**
+- **File**: (repo-dependent) likely request handler/middleware files where `StudentSchema.parse()` / `safeParse()` is used
+- **Action**: Confirm and, if needed, adjust error handling so invalid `firstName` yields a **4xx** with the intended message.
+- **Details**:
+  - Locate where student create/update endpoints validate payloads.
+  - Confirm Zod errors map to 400/422 (not 500).
+  - Confirm the response includes field-level errors or at least includes the message `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.
+  - If the current error formatter drops refine messages, adjust formatting to include them (without changing response shape beyond existing conventions).
+- **Rationale**: The task explicitly requires a 4xx validation error and clear message.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion #4; validation rule #7.
+
+**Step 5: Confirm frontend form validation architecture and where to place validator**
+- **File**: 
+  - `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+  - `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`
+- **Action**: Inspect how validation is currently done and decide the integration point.
+- **Details**:
+  - If `validators.ts` already exports field validators, add a `firstName` validator there.
+  - If the form uses Zod schema locally, either:
+    - add a reusable helper in `validators.ts` and use it in the Zod `refine`, or
+    - add a dedicated Zod schema for `firstName` in `validators.ts` and import it.
+- **Rationale**: Avoid inventing a new validation style; align with existing patterns.
+- **Addresses**: Validation feedback about underspecified architecture.
+
+**Step 6: Add frontend Unicode letter counting + validator + message constant**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts`
+- **Action**: Add reusable helper(s) and a validator for max 7 letters.
+- **Details**:
+  - Add `countUnicodeLetters()` using `/\p{L}/gu`.
+  - Add `FIRST_NAME_MAX_LETTERS_ERROR = "First name must contain at most 7 letters"`.
+  - Add a validator function (or zod schema) that checks:
+    - required (existing required rule)
+    - `countUnicodeLetters(value) <= 7`
+  - Export via consolidated export block at end of file.
+- **Rationale**: Centralize logic and error copy within frontend; reuse in form and tests.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria #1–#3; prevents drift within FE.
+
+**Step 7: Implement hard-stop behavior by sanitizing to max 7 letters (preserve non-letters)**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Action**: Update the `firstName` input handlers so the value cannot exceed 7 letters.
+- **Details** (commit to a concrete behavior):
+  - Implement a helper in the component (or imported from validators if appropriate):  
+    `const clampToMaxLetters = (value: string, maxLetters: number) => string`
+    - Iterate through the string by Unicode codepoints (JS string iteration is codepoint-aware for most cases) and:
+      - Count letters using `\p{L}` per character
+      - Append characters until letter count reaches 7
+      - After reaching 7 letters, still allow appending **non-letter** characters?  
+        - **Decision**: Yes, allow non-letters even after 7 letters (since they don’t count).  
+        - But if the user tries to add an additional letter beyond 7, that letter is dropped.
+  - Wire it into input updates:
+    - Maintain `firstName` as controlled value (or via form library controller).
+    - On `onChange`, compute `next = clampToMaxLetters(e.target.value, 7)` and set that as the value.
+    - Track `lastAttemptExceeded` (boolean) to show the inline message when clamping removed letters.
+      - Example: if `next !== e.target.value`, set an error state/message.
+  - **State management clarity**:
+    - You do not need to “revert to previous value” if you always clamp; the clamped value becomes the new value.
+    - Store the current value in the form state; store a separate UI flag for “user attempted to exceed”.
+- **Rationale**: This satisfies “hard-stop” for typing and paste while being user-friendly (paste results in a best-effort value rather than nothing).
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion #1; validation rule #5.
+
+**Step 8: Handle paste explicitly (optional but recommended)**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Action**: Ensure paste is also hard-stopped and triggers the same message.
+- **Details**:
+  - If using controlled `onChange` clamping, paste is already handled.
+  - Optionally add `onPaste` to:
+    - read clipboard text
+    - compute the would-be value
+    - set clamped value
+    - prevent default paste to avoid flicker
+  - Keep behavior consistent with typing.
+- **Rationale**: Some browsers/input setups may briefly show pasted content before React state updates; explicit paste handling can improve UX.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion #1 (paste behavior).
+
+**Step 9: IME/composition-safe enforcement**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Action**: Avoid clamping mid-composition; enforce on composition end.
+- **Details**:
+  - Track `isComposing` via `onCompositionStart` / `onCompositionEnd`.
+  - While `isComposing` is true:
+    - Allow `onChange` to update value without clamping (or clamp only non-destructively if proven safe in the codebase).
+  - On `compositionend`:
+    - Clamp the final value and set the “attempt exceeded” message if clamping occurred.
+- **Rationale**: Prevent breaking CJK/IME input while still enforcing the rule.
+- **Addresses**: Validation feedback about IME feasibility; acceptance criterion #1 robustness.
+
+**Step 10: Block submit and show inline error when invalid (defense-in-depth)**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.tsx`
+- **Action**: Ensure form submission cannot proceed if `firstName` violates the rule.
+- **Details**:
+  - Use the validator from `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` in the submit handler (or form library validation schema).
+  - If invalid:
+    - set field error state
+    - render inline error message: `First name must contain at most 7 letters`
+    - do not call the API
+  - Ensure required validation still works (empty string rejected).
+- **Rationale**: Even with hard-stop, defensive validation is required for edge cases and programmatic submission.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria #2 and #3; validation rules #1–#6.
+
+**Step 11: Confirm route wiring uses updated form**
+- **File**: `frontend/src/app/students/new/page.tsx`
+- **Action**: Verify the page renders the updated `StudentRegistrationForm` and no alternate path bypasses the new logic.
+- **Details**:
+  - Ensure no duplicate firstName input exists elsewhere.
+  - Ensure props don’t override validation/handlers.
+- **Rationale**: Ensures the change is active in the actual user flow.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria #1–#3 end-to-end.
+
+**Step 12: Outline required test updates (implemented in separate node)**
+- **File**: 
+  - `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.test.ts`
+  - `frontend/src/components/business/StudentRegistrationForm/StudentRegistrationForm.test.tsx`
+- **Action**: Add/adjust tests to cover the new rule and hard-stop behavior.
+- **Details** (explicit required cases):
+  - Backend Vitest:
+    - accepts exactly 7 letters: `"ABCDEFG"`
+    - accepts 7 letters + non-letters: `"ABC-DEFG"` (7 letters, 1 hyphen)
+    - rejects 8 letters: `"ABCDEFGH"` with message containing `First name must contain at most 7 letters`
+    - rejects empty string
+  - Frontend Vitest + RTL:
+    - typing hard-stop: attempt to type 8th letter results in value still having only 7 letters
+    - paste hard-stop: paste `"ABCDEFGH"` results in clamped value with 7 letters (and message shown)
+    - inline error shown when user attempts to exceed 7 letters (or when validation runs)
+    - submit blocked when invalid; submit allowed when 7 letters and other required fields valid
+- **Rationale**: Tests are in-scope; this plan must specify them even if implemented later.
+- **Addresses**: Task scope + acceptance criteria verification.
+
+**Step 13: Check for shared API client schemas/types and update if present**
+- **File**: repo-dependent (e.g., `frontend/src/lib/api/*`, shared `packages/*`, generated types)
+- **Action**: If the frontend uses a shared schema/type for student payloads, update it or ensure it remains compatible.
+- **Details**:
+  - Search for `StudentSchema` usage in frontend or shared packages.
+  - If a shared Zod schema exists, consider reusing it (or ensure both sides implement the same rule).
+- **Rationale**: Prevent mismatches where FE allows something BE rejects (or vice versa).
+- **Addresses**: Validation feedback about shared contracts.
+
+**Step 14: Ensure conventions and copy consistency**
+- **File**: all modified files
+- **Action**: Ensure code style and message consistency.
+- **Details**:
+  - Arrow functions only
+  - Consolidated exports at end
+  - Use the same exact error string in FE and BE (per-layer constant)
+- **Rationale**: Avoid lint/style failures and copy drift.
+- **Addresses**: Conventions + “keep error copy consistent”.
+
+---
+
+### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY
+
+- **Backend (authoritative)**:
+  - Zod refinement counts Unicode letters via `\p{L}` and enforces `<= 7`.
+  - Confirm validation failures return **4xx** and include the refine message.
+- **Frontend (UX + defense-in-depth)**:
+  - **Hard-stop** via clamping/sanitization ensures the input value cannot contain > 7 letters after any user action (typing/paste).
+  - **Inline messaging** appears when clamping occurs and/or when validation runs.
+  - **Submit blocking** re-validates and prevents API calls if invalid (covers edge cases like IME, programmatic value setting, or browser quirks).
+- **Consistency**:
+  - Same error copy string used across FE and BE (as constants per layer).
+
+---
+
+### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS
+
+- **Backend**:
+  - `backend/src/schemas/student.schema.ts` is the validation boundary for student create/update payloads.
+  - Request validation middleware/controller must parse with this schema and map failures to 4xx.
+- **Frontend**:
+  - `StudentRegistrationForm.tsx` is the UI entry point for student creation.
+  - `frontend/src/lib/validators.ts` (or existing validation module) is the shared frontend validation source.
+  - `/students/new` route must render the updated form.
+- **Potential shared contract**:
+  - If a shared schema/types package exists, it must be checked and updated or consciously left duplicated with parity.
+
+---
+
+### 6. EDGE CASES & CONSIDERATIONS
+
+- **Unicode letters**: `\p{L}` counts accented letters and non-Latin scripts as letters (desired).
+- **Non-letters**: spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, punctuation, digits do not count toward 7 and should remain allowed.
+- **After reaching 7 letters**:
+  - Additional **letters** are dropped (hard-stop).
+  - Additional **non-letters** are allowed (since they don’t increase letter count).
+- **Paste**:
+  - Pasting long strings should result in a clamped value (letters limited to 7) rather than rejecting the paste entirely.
+- **IME/composition**:
+  - Do not clamp mid-composition; clamp on `compositionend`.
+- **Empty string**:
+  - Still invalid due to required rule.
+- **Backend/Frontend mismatch risk**:
+  - Must ensure both count letters the same way (`\p{L}` with `u` flag).
+- **Runtime support**:
+  - Unicode property escapes require modern JS runtimes; confirm Node version and frontend build target support it (likely yes). If not, plan fallback (but only if repo constraints demand it).
+
+---
+
+### 7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
+
+- Focus ONLY on core feature implementation.
+- DO NOT write unit test code in this node (tests are implemented separately), but **do** keep the explicit test plan (Step 12) since tests are in-scope.
+- Follow existing codebase conventions and patterns:
+  - Arrow functions only
+  - Consolidated exports at end of file
+  - Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing form/validation architecture
+- Ensure type safety and code quality.
+- Maintain backward compatibility where applicable, except for the intended new validation rule.
+- Keep error copy consistent between FE/BE: `First name must contain at most 7 letters`.

+## Key Patterns
+
+- **app/** → pages, **components/** → UI
+- tests: `*.test.tsx` co-located with source
+- styles: SCSS modules (`*.module.scss`) per component
+- ui components: `Component/` folder w/ Component.tsx + .module.scss + .test.tsx + .example.tsx
+- api: `/lib/api.ts` single source for backend calls
+- env: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for backend endpoint
+
+
+2. `docs/coding-preferences.md`
+---FILE_CONTENT---
+- Function Syntax: Use arrow functions for all function definitions. Do not use the function keyword.
+
+- Export Pattern: Consolidate all exports into a single block at the end of the file. Do not use inline export keywords for individual variables, classes, or functions.
+
+- Testing Strategy: Zero Mocking: Do not use mocks, stubs, or spies in unit tests.
+
+  - Real Execution: All tests must call the actual implementation of functions and dependencies.
+
+  - Environment: Treat unit tests as functional integration tests. Since tests run against a dedicated database and target configuration, side effects are permitted.
+
+- No Emojis in messages while generating code
+
+- file naming conventions as small letters separated by hyphen
+
+- export types separately like `export type`, also import too

+
+## YOUR ROLE: EXECUTION NODE
+
+**THIS IS AN EXECUTION/DEVELOPMENT NODE**
+
+Your task is to implement the feature according to the comprehensive plan provided above.
+
+---
+
+## IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
+
+**THIS IS PURE DEVELOPMENT NODE ONLY**
+
+1. **Focus ONLY on Core Feature Implementation**
+   - Implement the feature functionality as described
+   - Ensure basic validation rules are in place
+   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
+
+2. **DO NOT Include in This Phase**:
+   - Unit tests (handled by other node)
+
+3. **Code Quality Standards**:
+   - Follow existing codebase conventions and patterns
+   - Write clean, readable, maintainable code
+   - Add clear comments for complex logic
+   - Use descriptive variable and function names
+   - Ensure type safety 
+
+4. **Integration Requirements**:
+   - Ensure changes integrate seamlessly with existing code
+   - Maintain backward compatibility where applicable
+   - Update necessary imports and dependencies
+   - Follow the project's file structure and organization
+
+---
+
+## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR THIS NODE
+
+Your implementation will be considered successful when:
+
+1. All acceptance criteria are addressed in the implementation
+2. All validation rules are enforced
+3. Code follows existing patterns and conventions
+4. Changes integrate properly with the existing codebase
+5. Basic functionality works as described
+6. No breaking changes to existing functionality
+7. All in-scope features are completed
+
+---
+
+## NEXT STEPS (Context for You)
+
+After you complete this pure development phase:
+- Other node will add comprehensive unit tests
+
+**Your focus now**: Deliver a working implementation of the core feature.
+
+---
