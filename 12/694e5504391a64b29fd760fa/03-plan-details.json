  "feedback": " -The plan explicitly says \"no tests in this node\" (Step 7 / constraints), but the task scope and requirements include adding/adjusting backend and frontend tests; the plan should at least acknowledge and outline the required test updates to satisfy in-scope items and acceptance criteria validation.\n -Backend step 2 mentions refine/superRefine but does not specify whether the schema should trim or normalize input before counting letters; the requirements mention \"after trimming if trimming is already part of existing behavior\"—the plan should include a concrete decision or a repo-check step to ensure consistent behavior.\n -Frontend hard-stop approach is left undecided (block vs truncate letters-only) and the plan does not commit to one behavior; acceptance criteria require the value \"does not exceed 7 letters\" and that the user \"sees a validation message\"—the plan should specify exactly how the UI will both prevent overflow and surface the message when an overflow attempt occurs.\n -The plan suggests using onBeforeInput/onPaste with onChange fallback but does not mention handling composition/IME events beyond a brief note; it should specify how to avoid breaking IME input while still enforcing the 7-letter rule (e.g., defer enforcement until compositionend) to ensure feasibility across browsers.\n -Backend validation error handling is assumed (\"existing error middleware behavior\") but not verified; the plan should include a step to confirm the API returns a 4xx on Zod validation failure and that the error message is surfaced as intended (acceptance criterion #4).\n -The plan proposes adding a frontend validator in frontend/src/lib/validators.ts \"if centralized validators exist\" but does not include a concrete repo-check step to confirm current validation architecture (e.g., react-hook-form + zod resolver vs custom); without that, implementation details for blocking submit and showing inline errors are underspecified.\n -The plan does not explicitly confirm that the same error copy string is reused from a shared constant in both FE and BE; it states consistency as a goal but does not specify how to prevent drift (e.g., centralizing the message per layer).\n -Step 4 mentions possibly reverting to the previous valid value onChange, but does not specify where that previous value is stored in the component state; the plan should clarify state management to make the hard-stop behavior actionable.\n -The plan does not mention updating any API client-side type/schema (if the frontend uses a shared Zod schema or generated types) to keep FE/BE validation aligned; it should include a check for shared contracts to avoid duplication or mismatch.",
